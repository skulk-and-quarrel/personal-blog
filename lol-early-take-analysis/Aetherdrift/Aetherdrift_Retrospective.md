Okay, here is the retrospective analysis of the Ether Drift Magic: The Gathering set based on the provided transcript.  

## Ether Drift Retrospective: Lords of Limited Analysis  

This analysis summarizes the retrospective evaluations and lessons learned about the Magic: The Gathering set **Ether Drift**, as discussed by Ben Wary and Ethan Sachs of Lords of Limited after approximately a month and a half of playing the format. They reflect on initial expectations versus the reality of gameplay, reassessing cards, mechanics, archetypes, and the overall format speed.  

## Overall Format Evaluation  

### Format Speed - Slower Than Expected  
**Timestamp:** 00:04:30  
**Current Evaluation:** The format played out significantly slower than initial previews suggested. It was one of the slower formats in recent memory, especially in the Play Booster era.  
**Initial Expectations:** Previews billed it as "too fast and too furious."  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "ether drift was build in previews as too fast and Too Furious but the vehicle set drove under the speed limit."  
- "this is actually one of the slower formats we've seen incertainly the play booster era and I feel like certainly just in our podcasting lifetime this is definitely an exception and not the rule."  
**Key Insights:** Initial impressions based on themes (Vehicles) can be misleading. Format speed dictates card evaluation significantly.  

### Card Evaluation Shifts - Slower Format Impact
**Timestamp:** 00:05:45  
**Current Evaluation:** Traditional Limited card evaluation heuristics were upended. Slower, value-oriented cards (Beast Rider Vanguard, Spin Out) overperformed, while typically strong aggressive cards (Nesting Bot) underperformed.  
**Initial Expectations:** Would have valued Nesting Bot much higher than Beast Rider Vanguard; Murder variants are not usually premium commons.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "stereotypical card evaluations in limited for the past couple years went by the wayside."  
- "nesting bot looks like a great one drop... wasn't that good of a card..."  
- "if you had told me I would value Beast Rider Vanguard ahead of nesting bot I would have laughed in your face..."  
- "spin out belongs on this list... when was the last time a murder variant was like oh wow this is really premium stuff at common it's just hasn't happened in a while."  
**Key Insights:** Format speed is paramount. Slower formats reward mana sinks, defensive capabilities, and late-game value over early aggression. Re-evaluate card types based on the specific format's tempo.  

### Format Complexity & Board Stalls  
**Timestamp:** 00:05:15 & 00:11:45  
**Current Evaluation:** The format was complex, often leading to intricate board states, especially with crewing chains. Board stalls were common, particularly in Green mirrors, but potentially avoidable with better deck building or by playing non-green synergistic decks.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly stated, but the discussion implies board stalls were a defining, perhaps overly emphasized, narrative.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "there are a lot of onboard tricks it was complex I think as far as games going long and the boards being full of a lot of stuff..."  
- "not seeing like a creature can crew a vehicle that then can crew a larger vehicle those were the things that got me the most..."  
- "The narrative for the format was board stalls but I'm not sure that that was what the format was offering and perhaps how people were engaging with it instead."  
- "I said I think shotty deck building on people parts... if you drafted other decks specifically grixis you would play against those green decks but the board didn't necessarily stall out..."  
**Key Insights:** Complex board states require careful attention. Board stalls might be a symptom of specific matchups or suboptimal deck building rather than an inherent, unavoidable feature of the format.  

### Format Metagame Phases  
**Timestamp:** 00:16:30  
**Current Evaluation:** The format evolved through distinct phases due to color imbalance and shifting perceptions: 1. Early phase: Force Green, White is terrible. 2. Middle phase: Grixis / Start Your Engines wide open as Green becomes contested. 3. Late phase: Realization that White is viable/underrated, Push the Limit decks emerge.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not applicable (describes evolution over time).  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "because of color imbalance the format went through three separate phases early force green white is terrible..."  
- "then after that in the middle of the format grixis and starer engines was wide open..."  
- "late it was like oh I mean sort of combo of oh push the limits nuts and you can always get it slash white is also significantly underrated so draft white..."  
**Key Insights:** Unbalanced formats often lead to distinct metagame shifts as players adapt and counter-adapt. Perceptions (like White being bad) can create opportunities later in a format's life cycle.  

### Overall Enjoyment
**Timestamp:** 00:50:15  
**Current Evaluation:** While perhaps not an "all-timer," Ether Drift was an enjoyable format they'd happily play again. The different speed, surprising card evaluations, and metagame shifts were positive aspects.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not applicable.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "ether drift may not be an all timer but we'd happily take it for another spin on the Block."  
- "I really liked ether drift I enjoyed the different speed of the format comparatively from the last few years I enjoyed the card evaluation uh surprises that it provided and I I also enjoyed the metag game shifts..."  
**Key Insights:** Formats deviating from recent norms can be refreshing. A format doesn't need perfect balance to be enjoyable; dynamic shifts can add interest.  

## Mechanic Evaluations  

### Start Your Engines  
**Timestamp:** 00:18:00  
**Current Evaluation:** A beautifully designed mechanic that rewarded tight drafting and deck building. It was underrated and misunderstood for much of the format. Payoffs were strong (Risen Necro Regent, Hour of Victory) and even smaller benefits (Surveyors becoming 2-for-1s, extra mana from Catalyzer, lifelink on Oilgorger) added up significantly.  
**Initial Expectations:** Potentially viewed as not impactful enough in a slower format, as suggested by other commentators (LR).  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "start your engines played out beautifully as a mechanic that really rewarded you for getting in a onew punch the turn that you started it."  
- "also think it was savagely underrated for most slash the entirety of the format and maybe not underrated but certainly misunderstood I would say."  
- "I loved sture engines I thought it was for me the cleanest mechanic and really rewarded tight Drafting and tight deck building..."  
- "...turning surveyors into actual two for ones was great getting two extra Mana from end Rider catalyzer... giving LifeLink to streaking oilgorger all that stuff also mattered and I think it was really overlooked."  
**Key Insights:** Build-around mechanics can be powerful even if subtle. Evaluating the sum of small advantages is crucial. Misunderstanding a mechanic can lead to it being underdrafted and potentially very strong for those who figure it out.  

### Exhaust
**Timestamp:** 00:20:30  
**Current Evaluation:** A great late-game mana sink, fitting well in a slower format. It functioned as a good variant of kicker. Green utilized it synergistically (e.g., Scurryfoot). Many exhaust effects provided value that couldn't be easily interacted with (unlike Adapt).  
**Initial Expectations:** Initially thought of as similar to Adapt.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly stated, but the positive evaluation suggests it performed well.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "exhaust was a great late game Mana sync in a format that could slash would get to the late game."  
- "exhaust is a great variant on kicker..."  
- "one of the things I think I didn't appreciate or just missed... was I was basically thinking it was that exhaust was adapt but so much of the exhaust stuff... you couldn't really mess with it in that sense which I think was good for the mechanic."  
**Key Insights:** Mana sinks are valuable in slow formats. Mechanics that provide guaranteed value upon activation (rather than relying on counters staying on a creature) can be more reliable.  

### Vehicles  
**Timestamp:** 00:21:30  
**Current Evaluation:** Generally not amazing cards individually, but Wizards did a good job making them playable and relevant without being overpowered. Pilot tokens and cards like Guidelight Matrix helped enable higher crew costs. Mid-range vehicles (Clamorous Ironclad, Apocalypse Runner) were important for battling Green's large creatures.  
**Initial Expectations:** Might have expected vehicles to be weak or potentially format-warping if pushed too hard.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "vehicles are generally not great cards but I think wiard the coast made them I think largely playable without pushing them too much..."  
- "broadcast Rambler thundering brood wagon all that sort of stuff it was it just laid in a really nice place..."  
- "pilot tokens helped that out... Guidelight Matrix... hidden tools to make things that would normally be like crew 3 crew 4 seem impossible actually was was quite doable."  
- "...those sort of middle of the road clunkier looking ones actually really played out nicely when like your clamorous Ironclad has six power or your apocalypse Runner has six power and can trade with those 66s from Green..."  
**Key Insights:** Supporting mechanics (like Pilot tokens) can make inherently weaker card types (Vehicles) viable. Card evaluation must consider the context of the format's threats (needing 6 power to trade with Green creatures).  

### Splashing  
**Timestamp:** 00:24:15  
**Current Evaluation:** Splashing was often possible due to the slower format speed and available fixing (Night Market Lookout, gain lands, Starting Column, Verdant Harthbike), but required prioritization. Fixing felt somewhat tight, requiring a concerted effort.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly stated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "because ether drift was slower splashing was often possible but you did have to prioritize fixing."  
- "there was a a good amount of it night market one of my favorite Commons in the set was great plus the the cycle of gain lands..."  
- "it felt fixing felt tight for me... I felt like you had to make a concerted effort to make a splash successful for sure."  
**Key Insights:** Slower formats enable splashing, but fixing availability is key. Don't assume splashing is free; actively prioritize fixing if it's part of the plan.  

### Cycling  
**Timestamp:** 00:42:15  
**Current Evaluation:** Monument to Endurance was the best payoff. Other payoffs like Marauding Mako and Scampire Skyray were decent in dedicated decks but perhaps fell flat otherwise or were too narrow. Push the Limit was the other premier payoff.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly stated, but implies some payoffs didn't live up to potential outside specific decks.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "Monument to endurance was the best payoff for cycling and I think massively underappreciated..."  
- "I kind of feel like at the end of the day the other ones fell flat like... I would have experiences where I thought my marauding makos were going to be great... felt like I actually don't have a lot of cycling stuff..."  
- "I think moranimoo and scaming skyray are just good cards in the blue red deck..."  
**Key Insights:** Evaluate build-around payoffs based on consistency and impact. Some payoffs require critical mass (Monument, Push the Limit), while others might be more incidental value (Mako, Skyray).  

## Color Pair / Archetype Performance  

### Green - The "Best" Color  
**Timestamp:** 00:07:45  
**Current Evaluation:** Green was arguably the best color due to deep, high-stat commons like Hazard of the Dunes and Migrating Kestron, which defined the format's "Rules of Engagement." Stampeding Scurryfoot was another standout common.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly stated, but the emphasis suggests Green's dominance was a key feature.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "green was the quote best color in the format thanks to a deep roster of Commons with great stats..."  
- "Hazard of the dunes and migrating ketron sort of defined The Rules of Engagement in the format..."  
- "stampeding scary foot as well... green had great com and I think that was a large part of its success..."  
**Key Insights:** Deep commons can make a color dominant, even in an era often defined by uncommons/rares. Identifying format-defining threats early is crucial for drafting and deck building.  

### Green Decks - Similar Game Plans  
**Timestamp:** 00:09:15  
**Current Evaluation:** Because Green's strength came from its powerful commons, most Green decks played out similarly, focusing on casting individually powerful creatures. Green was rarely just a support color.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not applicable.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "because of green deep Commons the green decks all tended to play out with similar game plans."  
- "Green wasn't a support color in a lot of decks... most green decks were heavy green and that's because if green was open you're getting all those Commons and green just like out commmon any other color correct."  
**Key Insights:** When a color's strength lies in universally good commons, its decks tend to be less diverse archetypically.  

### Non-Green Decks - Dealing with Green  
**Timestamp:** 00:10:00  
**Current Evaluation:** Non-green decks needed specific ways to handle Green's 6/6 threats, often relying on large vehicles (Broadcast Rambler, Apocalypse Runner, Marshall's Path Cruiser) to match up statistically.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not applicable.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "non- green decks needed ways to deal with six sixes which often came in the form of vehicles."  
- "broadcast Rambler again like stupid but once I realized... this card is a 54 plus a one one and that can tussle with ketron that's big game."  
- "Marshall's path Cruiser took me way too long to warm up to... realizing that those C just like keyword large... mattered in the format..."  
**Key Insights:** Understanding the primary threats of the dominant strategy is key to building effective counter-strategies. Vehicles provided a crucial way for non-green decks to compete on board size.  

### Black - Second Best Color  
**Timestamp:** 00:13:00  
**Current Evaluation:** Black was very close to Green in power level, possibly even better depending on perspective. Its strength came from synergistic and powerful commons like Wreckage Wickerfolk, Spin Out, and Pack Doll Terror, which played well in artifact-themed decks.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly stated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "black was not far behind Green in the color Power Rankings and maybe even ahead depending on who you talk to..."  
- "wreckage wicker folk spin out pack doll Terror these aren't like the chunky donkers that green gets... but they're also darn good and synergistic..."  
- "wreckage wicker folk was so good at enabling getting you to Max Speed... pack doll Terror was a game plan in and of itself... spin out was Great Removal..."  
**Key Insights:** Synergy can compete with raw power. Black offered powerful, synergistic commons that enabled strong non-green strategies.  

### White - Underrated & Viable Late  
**Timestamp:** 00:14:30  
**Current Evaluation:** White was disrespected for most of the format but was definitely viable, especially later on as players figured out how to build it (bigger decks, not aggressive ones) and could pick up powerful cards late due to its reputation.  
**Initial Expectations:** White was considered weak early on ("don't be white White's terrible").  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "white was disrespected for most of the format's life cycle but it was definitely viable to draft especially as the format matured."  
- "...there was a point where you were getting just egregiously powerful White cards fifth through eight pick because... The Narrative from content creators had been don't be white White's terrible..."  
- "a lot of the pitfalls of white was viewing an aggressive as an aggressive color and playing a nesting bot... avoiding those types of cards and playing playing bigger white decks..."  
**Key Insights:** Format perceptions can create value opportunities. Re-evaluating unpopular colors/strategies can be profitable. Understanding the *correct* way to build a color (e.g., Big White, not Aggro White) is crucial.  

### Blue - Weak Commons, Strong Uncommons  
**Timestamp:** 00:15:45  
**Current Evaluation:** Blue's commons were generally weak ("real stinky"), offering role-players but nothing exciting. However, its uncommons were incredibly strong (Spike-Shell Harrier, Stop Up, Rangers' Refueler, Transit Mage, Colossal Rattleback).  
**Initial Expectations:** Ben initially underestimated Blue due to weak commons.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "blue didn't have great Commons but it was super deep at uncommon."  
- "I owe blue an apology because I was kind of pooping on it earlier in the set... Blue's Commons are real stinky pretty much..."  
- "Blues uncommons are incredible Spike shell Harrier still my vote for best uncommon in the whole set..."  
**Key Insights:** Color strength isn't solely determined by commons. Deep, powerful uncommons can make a color very strong even with lackluster commons, especially in Play Booster formats.  

### Archetype Flavor - Wedges/Shards  
**Timestamp:** 00:22:45  
**Current Evaluation:** Although primarily a two-color format, many mechanics and synergies existed within three-color groupings (Wedges/Shards): Esper Artifacts, Mardu Start Your Engines (especially Rakdos), and Teemer Exhaust.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not applicable.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "ether drift was a two-color format lots of the mechanics lived in wedges and shards..."  
- "probably your favoritewas the esper artifact wedge for sure..."  
- "starer engines really lived in the mardu space and I think specifically black red was the best of those..."  
- "exhaust living in the teamer space."  
**Key Insights:** Mechanics can bridge color pairs, creating implicit three-color synergies even in a format that doesn't heavily support three-color decks.  

### Archetype Power Rankings (Official Lords of Limited)  
**Timestamp:** 00:32:15  
**Current Evaluation:**  
1. Green/Black ("Graveyard Stuff")  
2. Blue/Black Artifacts  
3. Red/Black Start Your Engines  
4. Blue/Red Discard  
5. Big White Decks  
6. 4-Color No-Green  
7. Green Late Game Soup (includes Blue/Green)  
8. Green/Red Beets  
**Initial Expectations:** Not applicable.  
**Supporting Statements:** List provided directly.  
**Key Insights:** Provides a final hierarchy of the perceived best performing and most synergistic decks in the format. Green/Black and artifact-based strategies ranked highly.  

### Push the Limit Decks - The "Zenith Flare" Archetype  
**Timestamp:** 00:36:30  
**Current Evaluation:** Push the Limit emerged as a powerful, fun build-around, akin to Zenith Flare. It was strong because the core card was bad outside the deck (so easily acquired), the supporting pieces were often low picks, and the payoff was truly competitive, potentially creating the best decks in the format.  
**Initial Expectations:** Haunt the Network was initially thought to be the "Zenith Flare" effect.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "push the limit this is one of the most fun cards we've had for Limited in a long time..."  
- "absolute garbage if you don't build around it... which means that people aren't randomly going to pick it highly..."  
- "the pieces that go with it most of them also not high picks so you can reliably get most of them..."  
- "truly competitive I think in in a way that a lot of build arounds of this ilk or not... the best versions of push limit decks are the best decks you can draft in the format."  
**Key Insights:** Successful build-arounds often feature payoffs that are unplayable otherwise and enablers that are low picks for other decks. This allows dedicated drafters to assemble powerful, synergistic decks consistently.  

## Card Reassessments  

### Nesting Bot vs. Beast Rider Vanguard  
**Timestamp:** 00:05:45  
**Current Evaluation:** Nesting Bot was surprisingly weak, while Beast Rider Vanguard was surprisingly effective.  
**Initial Expectations:** Nesting Bot looked like a great aggressive one-drop; Vanguard looked like a slow, clunky card.  
**Supporting Statements:** See "Card Evaluation Shifts" section.  
**Key Insights:** Don't assume standard card evaluations hold true; format speed dictates viability. Mana sinks (Vanguard) were better than cheap aggression (Bot).  

### Spin Out
**Timestamp:** 00:07:00  
**Current Evaluation:** A premium common removal spell.  
**Initial Expectations:** Murder variants haven't been premium commons recently.  
**Supporting Statements:** See "Card Evaluation Shifts" section.  
**Key Insights:** The value of unconditional removal increases in slower formats where threats are larger and games go longer.  

### Hazard of the Dunes & Migrating Kestron  
**Timestamp:** 00:07:45  
**Current Evaluation:** Format-defining commons due to their stats and abilities (Reach). Decks needed a plan to deal with them.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly stated, but their impact became clear through play.  
**Supporting Statements:** See "Green - The 'Best' Color" section.  
**Key Insights:** Identify the key threats that shape the format's interactions.  

### Marshall's Path Cruiser  
**Timestamp:** 00:10:00  
**Current Evaluation:** Took time to appreciate, but its 6 power was crucial for non-green decks to trade with Green's 6/6s, despite the high crew cost.  
**Initial Expectations:** High crew cost (5) would normally make it unplayable.  
**Supporting Statements:** See "Non-Green Decks - Dealing with Green" section.  
**Key Insights:** Evaluate cards based on the specific problems they solve in the format, not just generic heuristics (like high crew costs being bad).  

### Wreckage Wickerfolk  
**Timestamp:** 00:13:00 & 00:26:45  
**Current Evaluation:** Outstanding common. Synergistic powerhouse ("everything everywhere all at once") enabling artifacts, surveil, Start Your Engines, and providing a flyer. Top common in Black.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly stated, but clearly exceeded expectations.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "wreckage wicker folk was so good at enabling getting you to Max Speed..."  
- "it felt felt like that movie title what was it everything everywhere all at once like it just did so much for every archetype..."  
**Key Insights:** Cards that bridge multiple archetypes and mechanics are extremely valuable glue.  

### Rides End  
**Timestamp:** 00:14:30 & 00:26:15  
**Current Evaluation:** Excellent removal, especially in Big White decks. Top common in White. Its Exile clause was particularly relevant against Black's recursion.  
**Initial Expectations:** Likely undervalued initially when White was considered weak.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...playing playing bigger white decks you know with your broadcast Ramblers and whatnot I think it was really cool." (Context implies Rides End enables this)  
- "in white all hail rides end easy baby."  
- "...another reason why rides end was so good is that it had that magical word Exile..." (referring to Black recursion)  
**Key Insights:** Cheap, efficient removal is always good, but its stock rises in slower formats and against recursive threats.  

### Blue Commons (Generally) & Bounce Off  
**Timestamp:** 00:15:45 & 00:26:15 & 00:43:30  
**Current Evaluation:** Blue commons were generally poor. Bounce Off is likely the best, but even that is debatable (Keen Buccaneer considered). Bounce Off (and Defend the Rider) are about patience and picking the right spot for a tempo/value blowout, not just aggressive tempo.  
**Initial Expectations:** Blue commons were weak from the start. Bounce Off might have been initially viewed as a pure tempo play.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "Blue's Commons are horrendous... I think it's bounce off but I'm not even sure if that's true..."  
- "off and defend the rider are about patience not Tempo..."  
- "it's about identifying the turns or the the cards that are worth protecting... or that you have to pick your spots for doing..."  
**Key Insights:** Even the "best" common in a weak color might not be exciting. Tempo spells in slow formats are often better used defensively or to protect key threats/gain card advantage rather than pure aggression.  

### Thunderhead Gunner  
**Timestamp:** 00:27:00 & 00:45:15  
**Current Evaluation:** Incredible common, the best in Red. A huge body with reach that provided card filtering/advantage. Embodiment of a "clunky looking overperformer."  
**Initial Expectations:** Would not have expected it to be better than Lightning Strike pre-format.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "in red Thunderhead Gunner four in red four five reach... you just only Drew gas while there was a Thunderhead Gunner on the battlefield."  
- "if I told you preformat that you were going to have Thunderhead Gunner as the top common ahead of lightning strike like there just no world where you can imagine that right?"  
- Named winner of the "Imperial Oath Award" for clunky overperformer.  
**Key Insights:** Large defensive bodies with card advantage attached are extremely powerful in slower formats. Don't underestimate cards just because they look slow if the format supports them.  

### Top Commons Summary  
**Timestamp:** 00:26:15  
**Current Evaluation:**  
- White: Rides End  
- Blue: Bounce Off (weakest group)  
- Black: Wreckage Wickerfolk  
- Red: Thunderhead Gunner  
- Green: Hazard of the Dunes  
**Initial Expectations:** Grim Bobble and Lightning Strike were early frontrunners that didn't end up as the top commons.  
**Supporting Statements:** Explicitly listed.  
**Key Insights:** Highlights the surprising nature of the format's common evaluations compared to initial expectations.  

### Grease Wrench Goblin  
**Timestamp:** 00:34:00  
**Current Evaluation:** Overrated initially. Compared unfavorably to Kick Off Celebrations (discard 1 draw 2). The body often became irrelevant. Still a good card, but not as impactful as first thought, and significantly worse than Thunderhead Gunner.  
**Initial Expectations:** Compared to Fable of the Mirror-Breaker, implying high expectations. Ethan admits Ben was right that it was overrated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "grease wrench Goblin where where are we at on this card at the end of the day I been down... I feel like you've been too high on this card all format I think you're right."  
- "it's kind of like a more expensive kickoff celebrations... the body was just so I don't want to say irrelevant..."  
- "Thunderhead Gunner is Miles better than GRE wrench Goblin correct yeah."  
**Key Insights:** Re-evaluate cards based on actual gameplay impact. Small bodies become less relevant in formats dominated by larger creatures. Compare cards to similar effects within the set for better context.  

### Tyron, World Tyrant & Fang-Druid Summoner  
**Timestamp:** 00:35:15  
**Current Evaluation:** Tyron is indeed huge and impactful. Fang-Druid Summoner was excellent for tutoring Tyron or recurring it from the graveyard.  
**Initial Expectations:** Confirmed Tyron's power ("shout out to me").  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "tyion World Tyrant is in fact huge shout out to me..."  
- "a shout out to you also getting it with Fang Druid Summoner was quite good yeah I mean getting to either just tutor it up... or if Terry they your opponent somehow managed to... get it back..."  
**Key Insights:** Powerful threats combined with ways to find or recur them create potent strategies.  

### Uncommon Mana Creature Cycle (Tyron, Colossal Rattleback, etc.)  
**Timestamp:** 00:35:45  
**Current Evaluation:** An excellent cycle for card evaluation and the format. All were interesting and playable. Power ranking: 1. Tyron (Green), 2. Colossal Rattleback (Blue 0/8), 3. White 3/3, 4. Black 4/1, 5. Red 7/2. Even the weaker ones like the 4/1 were good because they could trade up.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly stated, but highlights their positive impact.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "that whole cycle of uncommon Manilla creatures was excellent for card evaluation and the format in general..."  
- "we could almost do a power ranking except like it's clearly Terry and then the other ones are just kind of cool..." (Proceeds to rank them).  
- "...a two Mana 41 was actually good because you could threaten to trade with Hazard of the dunes..."  
**Key Insights:** Interesting cycles can add depth. Even seemingly fragile creatures can be good if they trade favorably against key format threats.  

### Pack Doll Terror  
**Timestamp:** 00:39:00  
**Current Evaluation:** Insane in multiples, enabling all-in artifact decks. The 3/4 body was well-statted. Triggering on itself and providing non-combat interaction (drain) was powerful, especially with Haunt the Network. Great in non-Green Black decks.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly stated, but clearly a standout performer.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "pack all Terror insane in multiples and made the all-in artifact decks legit..."  
- "34 was really nice a nice spot on the curve for that um and the fact that it triggered on itself the fact that it gave you a way to interact..."  
- "a cool that it's such a powerful card for all of the black Decks that aren't black green..."  
**Key Insights:** Repeatable effects on well-statted bodies can define archetypes. Non-combat damage/drain provides valuable reach and interaction.  

### Grim Bobble & Lightning Strike  
**Timestamp:** 00:40:45  
**Current Evaluation:** Fell short of initial expectations as top commons but remained good, playable cards. Grim Bobble was matchup-dependent (great vs. non-Green, often bad vs. Green unless hitting Scurryfoot early). Value increased with synergy (Pack Doll Terror, sacrifice outlets). Never cutting the first Lightning Strike, but subsequent copies drop in priority.  
**Initial Expectations:** Were frontrunners for top commons.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "Grim Bobble and lightning strike were early Front Runners for top Commons in preview season that fell short I would say pretty drastically of our ourexpectations but yet somehow also are still pretty good..."  
- "Grim Bobble you cut lightning you're never I think you're the first copy makes your deck always..."  
- "g Bobble just has such a wide range if you're playing against a non- green deck it's incredible and if you're playing against a green deck it's it's largely bad..."  
**Key Insights:** Even efficient removal can be matchup-dependent. Initial evaluations need adjustment based on the prevalent threats and synergies in the format.  

### Howler's Heavy  
**Timestamp:** 00:41:45  
**Current Evaluation:** Great combat trick, particularly effective with and against deathtouch creatures (like Engine Rat). Difficult to play around once revealed.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly stated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "howler's heavy was great both with and against the death touch creatures in the format..."  
- "once you know your opponent has it like it's so hard to play against that card..."  
**Key Insights:** Powerful combat tricks can significantly warp combat decisions.  

### Guidelight Matrix  
**Timestamp:** 00:42:15  
**Current Evaluation:** Excellent enabler for chunky vehicles in non-green decks, made possible by the slower format speed allowing for a 2-mana cantrip that helps crew.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly stated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "chunky Vehicles were great in non- green decks and as a result so was guidelight Matrix that's only possible because the format is slower..."  
**Key Insights:** Enablers become more valuable when the strategy they support (expensive vehicles) is viable due to format speed.  

### Broken Wings  
**Timestamp:** 00:42:45  
**Current Evaluation:** Surprisingly maindeckable, potentially even in multiples, due to the prevalence of relevant targets (flyers, artifacts, enchantments).  
**Initial Expectations:** Typically, cards like Naturalize are not maindeckable.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "Broken Wings was actually maindeckable in this format just full op maybe multiple copies..."  
- "that's wild to me because that's like a question we've had... do we think natural is going to be maindeckable and we always end up on that the answer is no and then this one is just again the exception to the rule..."  
**Key Insights:** Always re-evaluate sideboard-style cards based on the specific threats and card types present in a format.  

### Explosive Getaway & Spectacular Pileup  
**Timestamp:** 00:43:15  
**Current Evaluation:** Massively underrated sweepers that could be acquired late. Very effective, especially Explosive Getaway's ability to save one of your own creatures (Time Wipe effect).  
**Initial Expectations:** Likely undervalued initially.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "because of the hate for white most of the format the sweepers were also massively underrated you could get explosive getaway and spectacular pileup spectacularly late yes and they were they were great..."  
**Key Insights:** Sweepers gain value in slower formats with board stalls. Misconceptions about color viability can lead to powerful cards being underdrafted.  

### Surveyor Cycle  
**Timestamp:** 00:44:15  
**Current Evaluation:** The slow format allowed these to reach their potential. Power Ranking: 1. Black (Mutant Surveyor - unblockable 4/5 threat), 2. Red (3/2 Trample), 3. Green (3/3), 4. Blue (2/2 Flying), 5. White (2/2 - significantly worse).  
**Initial Expectations:** White Surveyor was ranked highly pre-format, proving very wrong.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "the speed of the format meant that the cycle of surveyors got to realize their potential..." (Proceeds to rank them).  
- "I had of all these surveyors I had the white one in my top 10 comments that matter and it's like by far worst..."  
**Key Insights:** Reaffirms how format speed and context drastically alter card evaluations from preview season. Evasion and relevant stats were key differentiators in the cycle's performance.  

### Starting Column  
**Timestamp:** 00:41:30  
**Current Evaluation:** Winner of the "Golden Egg Award" for gluing archetypes together. Excellent for fixing/splashing, enabling Start Your Engines, artifact synergies, and draw-two/discard synergies. Pickable early to stay open.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly stated, but recognized as a key glue card.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "the golden egg award for the common that glues the most archetypes together goes to starting column..."  
- "...helped you Splash around start your engines... plays in the draw to discard space splashing was good starting columns great..."  
**Key Insights:** Flexible cards that enable multiple strategies and provide fixing are highly valuable, especially in formats where staying open is rewarded.  

### Earth Rumbler  
**Timestamp:** 00:44:45  
**Current Evaluation:** Large and in charge (7/6 Trample Vigilance), trivially easy to crew. Could dominate the board and had graveyard synergy. A potential "wire-to-wire" best card contender.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly stated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "Earth rumbler was large and in charge trivially easy to crew this was 76 power and toughness trample vigilance... some just folded to this being on the battlefield what a card."  
**Key Insights:** Huge, efficient threats are game-winning in slower formats.  

### Scrap Compactor / Siphon Fuel / Crash and Burn  
**Timestamp:** 00:45:45 & 00:46:15  
**Current Evaluation:** Clunky, overpriced removal was the best it's ever been because answering key threats (like Kestron) was essential in the long games. Scrap Compactor was demoralizing when the opponent had it active.  
**Initial Expectations:** These types of removal spells are often marginal.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "that overpriced colorless removal is back with scrap compactor yes..."  
- "clunky removal is the best it's ever been you you had to be able to get your man had to be able to get your ketron off the board..."  
- "it was really deflating also... when my opponents had it and you just know like the next good thing you play is dying..."  
**Key Insights:** In slow formats where specific threats *must* be answered, even inefficient removal becomes necessary and valuable.  

### Ether-Spark (Jace Planeswalker)  
**Timestamp:** 00:47:15  
**Current Evaluation:** Being an artifact was extremely cool and relevant. It could be tutored (Transit Mage), recurred (Tune Up), stolen (Trade the Helm), and importantly, destroyed by common artifact removal, making it less oppressive than typical Planeswalkers.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly stated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "The Ether spark being an artifact was extremely cool for limited..."  
- "...good for Limited in the sense that it was not quite as insanely oppressive because all of the cards that could blow up artifacts could just blow up the ether spark..."  
**Key Insights:** Making powerful permanents interact with common removal types (like artifact destruction) can balance them for Limited.  

### Black Recursion (Back on Track, Broodheart Engine, Carrion Cruiser, Dune Drifter)  
**Timestamp:** 00:48:00  
**Current Evaluation:** Black had numerous ways to recur threats, making exile effects (like Rides End) more valuable. Broodheart Engine, despite looking clunky, found a home.  
**Initial Expectations:** Broodheart Engine was initially dismissed as too clunky.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "black had so many ways to recur threats if they were sent to the graveyard this is another reason why rides end was so good..."  
- "brood heart engine another card I definitely rode off during the crash course I was like this is so clunky looking but brood heart engine had its time and was in a great deck..."  
**Key Insights:** Recursion adds resilience and value in long games. Re-evaluate clunky cards if the format supports their high cost/slow speed.  

### Thundering Brood Wagon  
**Timestamp:** 00:49:00  
**Current Evaluation:** Has "secret reach" which caught players off guard frequently.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly stated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "thundering brood wagon has reach I did it did you oh I I feel like I attacked into so many things..."  
- "...well you're so used to the giant flashing bow and arrow now and it's not there until that's a creature correct yeah until it's too late it really does actually have secret reach."  
**Key Insights:** Pay attention to all abilities on cards, especially less obvious ones like reach on vehicles that aren't always creatures.  

### Engine Rat
**Timestamp:** 00:49:45  
**Current Evaluation:** A very good card, providing a deathtouch blocker and a mana sink. Apologized for potentially underrating it, but still not considered among the absolute top tier Black commons (behind Wickerfolk, Terror, Spin Out, maybe Bobble/Surveyor).  
**Initial Expectations:** Implied they may have initially underrated it.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "engine rat we're sorry yeah we love you you are a very good card..."  
- "you're not on our list of top four black Commons right you're not in that top five..."  
- "it just does a lot it's it it trades with the thing it's a Mana sake..."  
**Key Insights:** Deathtouch and mana sinks are valuable, but context matters. Even good cards might not crack the top tier in a deep color.  

## General Lessons & Insights  

### Attacking Difficulty & Planning  
**Timestamp:** 00:11:15  
**Current Evaluation:** Attacking was difficult without a specific plan due to board complexity and potential stalls. It wasn't just about jamming creatures.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly stated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "attacking was difficult in the format if you didn't have a plan for how to do it."  
**Key Insights:** In complex or slower formats, having a clear plan for breaking through board stalls (evasion, tricks, removal, specific synergies) is crucial.  

### Commons Mattered  
**Timestamp:** 00:28:00  
**Current Evaluation:** Refreshing to see commons (especially Green and Black) play such a significant role in defining the format's power level, even in the Play Booster era where uncommons/rares often dominate.  
**Initial Expectations:** Might expect uncommons/rares to drive the format more heavily.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "speaking of Commons some of them really mattered in a format in the play booster era which was I think refreshing..."  
- "green and black especially getting deep Commons was cool I think it was a a unique Twist on the uncommons mattering type thing..."  
**Key Insights:** Don't discount the impact of commons, especially when a color has depth at that rarity.  

### Removal Quality & Scarcity  
**Timestamp:** 00:28:45  
**Current Evaluation:** Removal was great but felt somewhat hard to come by relative to the number of must-answer threats in long games (especially Green's 6/6s). Clunky removal became necessary. Efficient removal targeting small creatures (Grim Bobble, Lightning Strike) was less impactful than usual.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly stated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "removal was great but also kind of hard to come by because games went long longer and you needed to be able to answer your opponent's best cards..."  
- "Crash and Burn and siphon fuel as what look like pretty clunky removal spells... yeah but they get the job done..."  
- "some of the stuff that dealt with smaller creatures like the Grim bobbles of the world the lightning strikes of the world if you're coming back less good than you would think..."  
**Key Insights:** The value of removal shifts based on format speed and threat size. In slow formats with large threats, quantity and the ability to answer big creatures matter more than pure efficiency against small ones.  

### Reading Signals & Staying Open  
**Timestamp:** 00:29:45  
**Current Evaluation:** The format heavily rewarded reading signals and staying open. Taking gold cards early was discouraged. All decks felt competitive if drafted correctly based on open signals.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not applicable.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "ether drift really rewarded you for reading what was open in your seat I think all of the decks were competitive if you read what was open..."  
- "I really hate taking gold cards early in this format for this reason I just feel like it closes you off..."  
**Key Insights:** Flexibility and signal reading are premium skills, especially in formats with color imbalances or non-intuitive archetypes. Avoid committing too early.  

### Deck Building Nuance  
**Timestamp:** 00:30:30  
**Current Evaluation:** Archetypes weren't intuitive initially due to the slower speed and unexpected card performances (e.g., White being a "big" color, not aggro). Correct deck building was crucial but challenging.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not applicable.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "ether drift archetypes were not intuitive to figure out and build initially thanks to a slower format..."  
- "the biggest example of this is that white wasn't really that aggressive like the best white decks were big white decks..."  
**Key Insights:** Don't rely on default assumptions about color identity or archetype construction. Adapt deck building to the specific nuances and speed of the format.  

### Combat Trick Importance  
**Timestamp:** 00:31:30  
**Current Evaluation:** Certain combat tricks (Maximum Overdrive, Bestow Greatness) were crucial for enabling attacks into large Green creatures or winning combat in creature mirrors.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly stated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "certain combat tricks also stood out as ways to attack into large green creatures specifically I think the best of them Maximum Overdrive..."  
- "bestow greatness also could let you attack into green things..."  
**Key Insights:** Combat tricks that grant keywords like deathtouch, indestructibility, or trample are particularly valuable for breaking through board stalls or trading up against larger threats.  

### Artifact Hate Necessity  
**Timestamp:** 00:39:45  
**Current Evaluation:** Having ways to deal with non-vehicle artifacts (like Riverturn Monument, Perilous Snare, Ether-Spark) felt mandatory to avoid randomly losing to them. Cards like Broken Wings, Collision Course, Skycrash were important.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly stated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "having ways to deal with non-vehicle artifacts in your deck was a must it felt so bad randomly losing to rivert Monument or perilous snare..."  
- "...cards like Broken Wings actually M deal and wanting to have access to something like Collision Course or ether jacket or whatever Sky Crash..."  
**Key Insights:** Identify potential non-creature angle-shooting strategies (like Mill artifacts) and ensure you have answers available, potentially main deck if the threats are common enough.  

### Mill as a Viable Win Condition  
**Timestamp:** 00:40:15  
**Current Evaluation:** Mill was a real win condition via specific cards (Riverturn Monument, Ether-Siphon) and also through natural decking in very long, stalled games.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly stated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "speaking of Mill was a real wind condition in this format with rivert turn monument and ethersiphon just plus the games going long..."  
- "natural decking happened as well..."  
**Key Insights:** In very slow formats, alternative win conditions like Mill become more viable.  

### 2-Mana 2/2s Poorly Positioned  
**Timestamp:** 00:40:45  
**Current Evaluation:** Standard 2-mana 2/2 creatures were generally not good. They couldn't attack through common blockers (1/3s), died to cheap removal (Grim Bobble), and were outclassed in a slow format.  
**Initial Expectations:** 2/2s are often format staples.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "two Mana 22s are poorly positioned in the format you can't attack through 13s you die to Grim Bobble the format'sslow they're just not great cards."  
**Key Insights:** The value of generic bodies is highly dependent on format speed and common blocker sizes.  

### Format Inconsistencies (Minor Gripes)  
**Timestamp:** 00:45:30  
**Current Evaluation:** Pointed out several minor templating or mechanical inconsistencies that felt awkward (Pilot text variance, artifact targeting variance, Ghastly Blockbuster sacrifice restriction, Push the Limit not saddling mounts, Thopter Fabricator trigger).  
**Initial Expectations:** Not applicable.  
**Supporting Statements:** Detailed list provided in the transcript.  
**Key Insights:** Primarily flavor/templating issues rather than major gameplay impacts, but highlights areas where rules text could be clearer or more consistent.  

### Few Oppressive Bomb Rares  
**Timestamp:** 00:48:30  
**Current Evaluation:** The format had good rares, but very few felt truly oppressive or invalidated long games (Sivriss and the Frog God mentioned as maybe the most egregious). High-powered, interactive games were common and fun.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly stated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "for a slow format there were very few bomb rares that invalidated long games..."  
- "not to say that there weren't good rarest here were good rares but you were trading high power level cards over the course of the format and it was really fun playing High powerered long games of magic."  
**Key Insights:** A lower density of game-breaking bomb rares can lead to more interactive and engaging gameplay, especially in slower formats.
