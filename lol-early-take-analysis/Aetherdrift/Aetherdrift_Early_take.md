This document summarizes the initial predictions, evaluations, and hot takes on the Magic: The Gathering set **Aetherdrift**, based on Early Access gameplay discussed in the provided transcript. The analysis focuses on first impressions of mechanics, archetypes, colors, format speed, and specific cards.

*Note: Timestamps were not available in the provided transcript.*

## Format Overview & Speed

### Format Speed - Slower than expected
**Take:** The format felt slower than initially anticipated during Early Access, with games often going longer despite the presence of aggressive mechanics. Aggro decks aren't necessarily the default Tier 1.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "despite feeling like we got start your engines and nailed that as like the major mechanic of the format the set didn't feel as fast as I thought it was"
- "more so than not I was surprised at the amount of like 20 minute games I was having during Early Access"
- "my thought going in was that the the aggro decks would have been tier one going in and some some of them are some of them aren't"
- "if both people play to the board... the games go a long time or or or can go a long time"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Board Stalls & Vehicles - Contribute to slower speed
**Take:** Vehicles, while not inherently great, contribute to board stalls that slow down the game, making profitable attacks difficult without evasion.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I think one of the things that contributes to that is Vehicles... it's hard when your opponent has a couple creatures and a couple vehicles to attack profitably into them if you don't have evasion"
- "you always think well do I have attacks here if my opponent goes like crew crew block block with their vehicles... I just can't really push the rest of the damage"
**Confidence Level:** Medium

### Removal Scarcity - Feels lower than expected
**Take:** Despite appearing plentiful on paper, removal felt scarce in practice during drafts and gameplay, increasing the value of interaction.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "removal even though I felt like it was plentiful... it felt scarce"
- "it looks like there's a normal amount of removal in the format but like it didn't feel that way in the packs"
- "there were multiple times in games where both me or my opponent were in a spot where like if we have a removal spell we're Gucci and just like didn't have it for two or three turns"
- "I got to bump up interaction just because it felt hard to come by"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Two-for-Ones Scarcity - Potentially lower than average
**Take:** There might be a relative scarcity of efficient two-for-one card advantage effects, making cards that provide card advantage more valuable. (Note: Disagreement between hosts on the degree of scarcity).
**Supporting Statements:**
- (Ben) "I also felt like two for ones were kind of scarce too"
- (Ben) "it was sort of like cuz the board stall stuff happens and then someone's like here's a hull Drifter and you're like oh you now are up two cards on me that feels really hard to overcome"
- (Ethan) "I don't know that I really felt that... I didn't feel like we reached Foundation levels of two for ones were hard to come by"
**Confidence Level:** Medium (due to host disagreement)

### Format Balance - Generally balanced
**Take:** The format feels relatively balanced across archetypes, with most strategies seeming viable, although some are clearly stronger than others.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "it felt pretty balanced to me as far as archetype wise there wasn't a ton where I was like H that really doesn't seem like it's going to get there"
- "I was largely impressed by a lot of decks that I expected to not be good"
- "it feels close yes nothing feels I think outside of green white which might even still have some play to it like everything feels viable and good and pretty close"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Format Identity - Synergy vs. Raw Rate Spectrum
**Take:** The format can be understood on a spectrum from highly synergistic decks (often Grixis colors) to raw card quality/rate decks (often Green-based). Knowing where your deck falls on this spectrum is key.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "to me it's knowing whether you're trying to be synergistic a start your engines aggro deck or a raw card quality deck"
- "I think the more you draft Green the more you're just independent card quality"
- (Ben's Spectrum): Blue (Synergy) -> Red -> Black (Middle/Support) -> White -> Green (Raw Rate)
- (Ethan's Spectrum): Black (Synergy/Start Engines) <-> ??? <-> Green (Raw Rate)
**Confidence Level:** High

### Overall Format Feel - Optimistic
**Take:** Initial impressions are positive; the format seems fun, powerful without being overly dominated by rares, rewards synergistic building, and offers diverse competitive strategies.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I think I'm just optimistic about the format... this set might fall flat this seems like it might just be great I that's that's my current take"
- "I really enjoyed Early Access"
- "it doesn't feel pushed all in one direction there's a smattering of it all and it all feels competitive I I'm I'm really optimistic about the format"
**Confidence Level:** High

## Mechanic Assessments

### Start Your Engines - Well-designed and impactful
**Take:** Start Your Engines is a well-executed, interesting mechanic that creates meaningful gameplay decisions and is a real threat, particularly in Mardu colors. Getting to Max Speed early (Turn 4-5) is important.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "is a really cool interesting mechanic in the gameplay because you have to... make an evaluation about how much do I think my opponent really cares about this"
- "it's a super real threat in Marty decks and they give you cardsto try to get it turned on"
- "the Maru decks get it by turn four turn five pretty consistently"
- "if you're playing against mardu and you have the opportunity I think you really want to try to stop your opponent from getting Max Speed yes"
- "the coolest thing about start your engines is the ability to set up turns where you start it and get it up to two"
- "finding the non-combat ways to hit Max Speed... is really important too"
- "it doesn't feel snowbally so much it just feels once it hits the cards are just better"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Exhaust - Good late-game sinks, not archetype-defining
**Take:** Exhaust cards provide good late-game mana sinks and value, but the Temur (Green-Blue-Red) color pairs don't feel like dedicated "Exhaust decks" as much as decks that happen to play good cards, some of which have Exhaust.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "the exhaust cards are just good late game SNS right"
- "I don't think you should think about green red or green blue particularly as being exhaust decks you're just drafting really good cards and the exhaust cards are good cards"
- "it just doesn't end up feeling as greater than the sum of its parts as the grixis decks"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Discard/Cycling (Blue-Red) - Strong package, resilient deck
**Take:** The discard/cycling theme, primarily in Blue-Red, is impressive. It functions as powerful synergy packages within a deck that plays strong cards from top colors, rather than being a fragile, all-in strategy.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "discard and cycling very impr red like and not necessarily so impressed with the Synergy it felt like packages of synergy that were powerful"
- "the deck is very resilient it can play offensively it can play defensively it gets to hold up mana a ton and gets to play play great cards"
- "it's very hard to play against because... it has reach thanks to the 14 um that every time you discard a card it pings your opponent"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Vehicles - Play good ones, avoid mediocre ones
**Take:** Common vehicles are largely not worth playing. Focus on rare and strong uncommon vehicles. Avoid putting too many vehicles in your deck.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "the common Vehicles largely not worth it"
- "you want rare and good uncommon vehicles and there are some Banger rare and good uncommon vehicles and those you should play"
- "if you are prone to putting seven or eight vehicles in your deck probably don't"
- "be cognizant of putting great vehicles in your deck and not putting mediocre vehicles in your deck"
**Confidence Level:** High

## Color Pair Analysis & Rankings

### Updated Color Power Rankings (Consensus Leaning)
1.  **Blue:** Strong artifact and cycling synergies. Best color at increasing value of other cards. All 4 archetypes feel good.
2.  **Red:** Great aggressive color (Red-Black), strong discard/cycling (Blue-Red). Plays well with Start Your Engines. Lots of banger uncommons.
3.  **Black:** Best support color. Excellent glue cards (Wreckage Wickerfolk, Pack Doll Terror). Pairs well with all colors via artifacts, Start Your Engines, graveyard synergy.
4.  **Green:** Raw card quality and rate. Has individually powerful cards (Hazard of the Dunes). Less synergistic focus, can feel "at the mercy of the packs".
5.  **White:** Underwhelming commons/uncommons. Lacks good removal. Vehicle focus is a drawback. Best when paired with Blue/Black for artifacts.

**Supporting Statements:**
- (Blue) "I would still have blue number one I think the the artifact Synergy stuff was as real as I thought it was going to be"
- (Red) "I love red I mean I almost want red in first... I love how red gets to play with everything going on in the format"
- (Black) "I think it is by far the best support color in the format and it it gets so many glue cards"
- (Green) "I do probably think Green's a better intrinsic color than black but I just don't like I don't expect me personally to go into the format drafting green"
- (White) "I had white in fifth place last week and I because I was just like I don't like these cards... white just really struggles to fill that in with its Commons and uncommons"
**Confidence Level:** High

## Archetype Predictions

### Tier 1 Archetypes
**Take:** The Grixis (Blue-Black-Red) archetypes, particularly Blue-Black Artifacts, Blue-Red Cycling, and Red-Black Start Your Engines Aggro, appear to be the strongest decks in the format due to their high synergy levels. Blue-White Artifacts is also strong, though potentially closer to Tier 1.5/2.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I think the Synergy decks are the best decks in the format right now and so I think that grixis Shard... all three of those color pairs are highly synergistic and I think where the best decks in the format live"
- "Tier one I think obvious... three of the blue decks blue black blue red blue white" (Ben's initial list)
- "red black I think red black is insane as a start your engine's aggro deck... super impressed with red black"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Tier 1.5 / Tier 2 Archetypes
**Take:** Green-Black (Graveyard/Synergy) and Blue-Green (Raw Rate/Exhaust) impressed and moved up, potentially reaching Tier 1 status. Red-White (Aggro/Start Your Engines) and White-Black (Attrition/Artifacts/Start Your Engines) are viable Tier 2 decks.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I was largely impressed by a lot of decks that I expected to not be good like I was going in low on green black was super impressed by green black"
- "movers up green black blue green to tier two maybe tier one"
- "red white and white black living in tier 2 as well"
- (Ethan on Blue-White) "I would put that in tier two I think blue white is good not great"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Bottom Tier Archetypes
**Take:** Green-White and Green-Red felt underwhelming compared to other archetypes. Green-White seems particularly weak ("Loran lottery").
**Supporting Statements:**
- "Certainly was underwhelmed with green white I I would not no longer I think put green white in as a deck I expect to be tier one"
- "green white was a deck that I think we were both like oh this is going to just hit so hard and it just doesn't feel like it does"
- "green white is my vote for worst deck in the format right now"
- "I've got green white and green red in in the in the bottom grouping"
**Confidence Level:** High

## Card Evaluations (Movers Up / Impressive)

### Pack Doll Terror (3B Common Artifact Creature) - Top Common Contender
**Take:** This card significantly overperformed expectations. It's incredible in artifact-heavy decks (UB, BW, RB), provides reach, dodges key removal, and stacks well. A major pull towards Black artifact strategies.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I think this is the single biggest moover up of the format for me this is so incredible"
- "it's insane in blue black it's it's very good in black white and red black"
- "the body is huge it Dodges lightning strike... it's a hard card to kill"
- "it is I think I I would have it as one of the top Commons in the format I think for me right now"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Spin Out (1BB Instant) - Premium Removal
**Take:** The value of this instant-speed unconditional removal spell has increased significantly due to the perceived scarcity of interaction.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "spin out stalks are going up for me like I that is I think the best way to describe the removal situation is I'm the highest on that card I have ever been in my life"
- "would not be shocked if spin out started to move ahead of grim Bobble for me"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Wreckage Wickerfolk (1B Common Artifact Creature) - Premium Glue
**Take:** This 1/3 flying artifact creature with ETB Surveil 2 is a premium common and excellent glue for multiple Black archetypes (Artifacts, Start Your Engines, Graveyard).
**Supporting Statements:**
- "it gets so many glue cards stuff like the one three flyer for one in a Black surveil 2 like insane in artifacts it's insane in red black sture engines it's great in green black graveyard"
- "wreckage wicker folk is just a big mover up for me... it definitely would be in my top 10"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Flood the Engine (2U Common Aura) - Near Premium Removal
**Take:** This Pacifism variant that taps and removes abilities is close to premium removal in Blue, effectively acting like sorcery-speed unconditional removal.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "flood the engine I think is close to a premium removal spell in the format"
- "That's basically sorcery speed murder in the format"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Outpace Oblivion (2R Uncommon Enchantment) - Top Uncommon
**Take:** Excellent uncommon that combines premium removal (deals 5) with enabling Start Your Engines efficiently.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "card rules I had it as my top red uncommon last week I love this card"
- "it like does your one two start your engines thing perfectly removal is a premium plus this doing the start your engines thing this card's excellent"
- "I would expect outpace Oblivion to be one of the best uncommons in the format I think"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Risen Necro-Regent (4B Rare Creature) - Build-Around Payoff
**Take:** This "Grave Titan" is an excellent payoff for Start Your Engines decks, but requires building around enabling Max Speed to be great. Mediocre otherwise.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I love this you're calling it grave Titan this card is grave Titan"
- "The St your engines cards the ones that we ticked off as like the ones that matter this the 34 that draws you a card every turn an hour of Victory those three cards are worth building towards"
- "risen necro Regent is not a premium card if you're not good at enabling start your engines before it comes down... if you can consistently get it down with Max Speed either hitting or imminent it's like a B+"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Magitek Artillerist (2R Common Creature) - Good Roleplayer
**Take:** The 1/4 pinger is better than it looks, playable in most Red decks (not Red-Green). Its cycling trigger dealing damage helps enable Max Speed pre-combat.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I think you're playing it in any red deck that's not red green probably because the when you cycle itself at dealing that damage and Ticking you up to your fourth Max Speed before combat happens is I think really good"
- "been very impressed with it"
**Confidence Level:** Medium

### Dredger Insight (1G Uncommon Enchantment) - GB Powerhouse
**Take:** Outstanding card for the Green-Black graveyard deck, providing card selection, fueling the graveyard, and offering incidental lifegain. Can be a signal to move into the archetype.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "that card is outstanding in green black"
- "if I'm not green and I see a dredger Insight go by and then all of a sudden I see that vehicle like you might start thinking about audibling into green black"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Earth Rumbler (4G Uncommon Vehicle) - Better Than Expected
**Take:** This large vehicle is quite good, especially since its primary deck (Green-Black) is viable. The ability to crew by exiling from the graveyard is strong synergy.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "we knew Earth Rumble was going to be a good card but... I think your expectation is but its deck is g to flop... no the deck isn't a flop so ergo it gets bumped up"
- "I had this in a green black deck with two dredgers insites... I just got to sometimes be like okay gain 10"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Molt Tender (G Uncommon Creature) - Strong in GB
**Take:** This mana dork that can exile from graveyards is surprisingly strong in Green-Black, fueled by mill effects like Dredger Insight or Pothole Mole.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "it's really strong in in green black"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Grim Javelineer (2B Common Creature) - Solid Filler
**Take:** Looks like filler but plays much better. A good 22nd/23rd card in most Black decks, providing relevant buffs, enabling attacks, and offering valuable Surveil.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "this looks like like the filler EST of filler and it is so much better than that"
- "it's such a good 22nd 23rd type card in almost every black deck"
- "really love Grim Javelin here"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Guidelight Optimizer (1U Common Artifact Creature) - Glue Card
**Take:** This 2/1 artifact mana dork is a great glue card for Blue decks, enabling artifact synergies, helping cast expensive Exhaust abilities, and even fueling cycling.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "this card does work you got to play to the board early it's an artifact for the artifact Synergy decks and it's a Mana dork for the exhaust decks"
- "this is a great great glue card for the blue artifact decks and then blue green exhaust also helps you cycle for the cycling decks"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Transit Mage (2U Common Creature) - Reliable Tutor
**Take:** Good common that reliably tutors for key artifacts, most notably Pack Doll Terror, making that powerful common more consistent.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "not surprising that it's a really good card but it's basically another copy of P doll teor which is super important"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Kitan Gravestalker (5B Common Creature) - Common Build-Around
**Take:** This cost-reduced 5/4 is a potential common build-around, primarily for Green-Black graveyard decks.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "shout out to you I think this card is a common build around for the format"
- "largely a green black gold card but it gets there in green black"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Beastrider Vanguard (1G Common Creature) - Playable Filler
**Take:** Better than initially assumed due to removal scarcity and the value of card advantage. A playable card in Green decks, though not premium.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "when my opponents played this during Early Access I was not happy"
- "I agree you're not on an island... it was a problem I had to spend a four man removal spell on it several times"
- "I don't think it's premium but I think greenex will play that card"
**Confidence Level:** Medium

### Howler's Heavy (3U Common Creature) - Cycling Mode Impressive
**Take:** The main body is mediocre, but the cycling ability (1U: Target creature gets -3/-0, draw) is an impressive combat trick/tempo play, especially in Blue-Red Cycling. Might be preferable to Nimble Thopterist.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "the two Mana thing gets minus three minus o draw card that has been an impressive trick and especially impressive in cycling"
- "I kind of feel like I'm supposed to take howler's heavy I don't like thopterist currently"
**Confidence Level:** Medium

## Card Evaluations (Movers Down / Underwhelming)

### Nimble Thopterist (3U Common Creature) - Underwhelming
**Take:** Expected to be a top common, but proved underwhelming. It's a fine playable (C+ at best), but doesn't pull you into Blue and is only actively desired in specific artifact synergy decks (UB/UW).
**Supporting Statements:**
- "two cards that I expected to perform well that I don't think did... are Nimble thopterist and trip up"
- "I was woefully under impressed by both of them during Early Access"
- "maybe this car just isn't as good as I think it is it's a C+"
- "I think it's even less than a c plus... it's like a C+ in two decks"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Trip Up (1U Instant) - Underwhelming
**Take:** Like Nimble Thopterist, this expected top common felt underwhelming in practice.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "two cards that I expected to perform well that I don't think did... are Nimble thopterist and trip up"
- "expected both of those to be top Commons in the format and I was woefully under impressed by both of them"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Stampeding Scurryfoot (G Common Creature) - Disappointing (Ben's Take)
**Take:** While not bad, this card felt small-ball and less impactful than expected. Spending four mana (initial G + 3G exhaust) for a 2/2 and a 3/3 isn't a format-defining play. (Note: Strong disagreement from Ethan who keeps it as a top common).
**Supporting Statements:**
- (Ben) "stamp beating Scurry foot has been it's fine it's not bad by the time that you exhaust it though it's a little smallball"
- (Ben) "I don't think it is a format defining card I guess that's what I would say"
**Confidence Level:** Medium (due to strong host disagreement)

### Crash and Burn (3R Instant) - Clunky Defensively
**Take:** This removal spell felt clunky and inefficient when used defensively, often trading down significantly on mana against key two-drops. Might be better in aggressive decks as a curve topper.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I was even in draft a little underwhelmed with Crash and Burn... it really felt terrible being a four Mana spell that I was trying to use defensively"
- "I was always trading down on Mana"
**Confidence Level:** Medium

### Grim Bobble (B Sorcery) - Slightly Downgraded
**Take:** Still a very good card, but the sorcery speed is a significant drawback compared to instant-speed removal (can't regain tempo on the draw), and it lines up poorly against Green's larger creatures.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I felt it not having flash... the fact that it's not instance like it's it not Shock like it doesn't catch you up when your opponent is on the play"
- "the fact that it lines up poorly against some of the Decks that are good decks like green Black's a great deck green blue is a good deck"
- "I just am a little lower on it than I was going into the format"
**Confidence Level:** Medium

### Dynamite Diver (R Common Creature) - Too Small Ball
**Take:** This 1/1 pilot feels too small and defensive for what Red decks typically want to do. Better ways exist to enable Start Your Engines.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "this feels a little too small ball for the format"
- "it's small ball without being aggressive like red doesn't particularly want a defensive card like this"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Ripclaw Wrangler (3B Common Vehicle) - Avoid
**Take:** Poster child for mediocre vehicles you should avoid putting in your deck.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "this I think is the poster child for vehicles we're talking about when we say don't put too many vehicles in your deck"
- "I think think you should just basically never put ripclaw Wrangler in your deck"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Lotus Guard Disciple (2W Common Creature) - Doesn't Do Enough
**Take:** This flyer doesn't have a clear home or purpose. The ETB effect isn't impactful enough, and it lacks key mechanics like Start Your Engines.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "what where does this go like what are you what are you trying to do with it it just doesn't do enough"
- "why does this not have sture engines on it"
- "Lotus card disciple is just not a good card I don't think"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Gear Seeker Serpent (5UU Common Creature) - Clunky / Not Needed
**Take:** While playable in artifact decks, it's clunky and generally not needed or wanted as a finisher in the good artifact strategies, which have better options like Pack Doll Terror. Not a build-around.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "it's fine you could play it an artifact decks but it is it is nowhere close to a build around"
- "I think the good artifact decks just don't need it or want it as a finisher"
- "if this is cheap you're already winning the game"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Hacksaw Swipe (B Sorcery) - Cost is Too High
**Take:** The additional cost of sacrificing a creature or artifact is often too steep, making this removal spell feel like a two-for-one against yourself. Likely sits out more decks than it makes.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I just found that there was not a ton to sacrifice happily this it was really hard to make this not feel like a two for one in my opponent's favor"
- "I think this will sit out of more black decks then it will sit in"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Midnight Mangler (1U Common Vehicle) - Doesn't Do Enough Defensively
**Take:** Begrudgingly playable two-drop for artifact decks, but poor defensively, especially against flyers which are relevant for stopping Start Your Engines.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "this just doesn't quite do enough"
- "it's so bad against Flyers... this doesn't stop them from getting sture engines"
- "I don't think it's as good of a defensive card as I thought in the format"
**Confidence Level:** High
