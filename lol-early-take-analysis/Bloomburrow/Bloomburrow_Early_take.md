## Bloomburrow First Impressions Overview

This transcript covers the initial impressions and early evaluations of the Magic: The Gathering set Bloomburrow ("Bloomo") in the Limited format, based on Early Access event gameplay and pre-release experiences. The hosts discuss the overall feel of the format, the strength of colors and archetypes, key mechanics, and specific card evaluations, comparing it to previous sets like core sets, Modern Horizons 3, and Outlaws of Thunder Junction.

## Overall Format Assessment

### Format Feel - Core Set + Synergy
**Timestamp:** [0:01:50]
**Take:** The format feels like a core set but with significant, built-in synergy. Decks can achieve very high power levels ("Modern Horizon 3 power levels") if synergies align, but can also falter like traditional core set decks if they don't find engines.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "it's kind of interesting the format feels to me like a core set but that has a lot of synergy it's like introduction to Synergy"
- "if you hit the synergies for your color pair your decks can do extremely dumb things like modern Horizon three power levels of dumb things but then there's also just core set type games where you can really run out of gas or flood in the format if you don't have engines or your synergies don't set up engines for you"
**Confidence Level:** Medium

### Format Feel - Linear & Prescriptive
**Timestamp:** [0:02:30], [0:03:00]
**Take:** The format feels extremely linear, with color pairs having very specific game plans. Success relies on finding the open lane and executing its prescribed synergy ("paint by numbers"). This might impact long-term replayability.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "the format feels extremely linear to me at the onset right color pair and this is not a surprise color pairs do specific things and you want to find your way into to whatever the open color pair is for your seat"
- "I do think it is pretty prescripted what the synergies of your deck are going to be much more so than modern Horizon 3"
- "I think paint by Synergy paint by numbers is a is a a great way to describe it but it's still a really cool work of art if you manage to do the Synergy paint by numbers"
**Confidence Level:** Medium

### Format Feel - Secret Gold Cards / Guild Set Vibes
**Timestamp:** [0:05:25]
**Take:** The format has vibes of a Guild set due to many cards feeling like "secret gold cards" â€“ cards technically playable in multiple decks of a color but only truly effective or synergistic within one specific archetype.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I also felt like Vibes of Guild sets because of the amount of what I felt were secret gold cards"
- "I definitely had experiences where black green was the deck I was drafting there were black and green cards in the pack but they weren't cards for the black green squirrels Forge deck"
**Confidence Level:** Medium

### Format Feel - Snowball Rares
**Timestamp:** [0:10:35]
**Take:** Similar to Outlaws of Thunder Junction (OTJ), the format features many "snowball rares" that demand an immediate answer or quickly take over the game.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I have found that we're or felt that we're back in Outlaws of Thunder Junction territory with not not like hit the battlefield two for one rares but like you better answer me or like next turn this is worse and the turn after it's worse like snowball rares is what I have felt"
**Confidence Level:** Medium

### Strategy - Find the Open Lane
**Timestamp:** [0:11:10], [0:49:45]
**Take:** Finding the open two-color archetype is crucial for success, rewarded by both synergistic commons/uncommons and powerful archetype-specific rares.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "you need to stay open and you need to find an open archetype in this format and those rares being that way make it so that if you do find the open archetype you can get hugely rewarded with rares too"
- "basically you just want to be wherever is open"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Strategy - Prioritize Flexible Cards Early
**Timestamp:** [0:06:55], [0:13:50]
**Take:** Early in the draft, prioritize cards that are flexible or generally good in a color ("glue cards") over narrow, archetype-specific cards to stay open longer.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "identifying what the flex or glue cards are because the one like getting to start off with cards that are just going to be good in any deck versus trying to shoot the moon a little bit"
- "cards that are flexible or just good on their own are my highest priority... I much more would rather like feel the draft out a little bit with cards like the sto and drift Gloom coyote before getting something like Harvest Right host"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Strategy - Avoid Incorrect Pivots
**Timestamp:** [0:15:10]
**Take:** Be cautious about pivoting based on seeing strong gold cards mid-pack if you're already established. It's easy to get caught trying to draft two different decks, which is detrimental. Pivots are more likely within a primary color's archetypes (e.g., Green deciding between Frogs/Squirrels).
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I think you can get in some real trouble here with the gold cards in the set... getting to attach that seag Glade Mentor you saw Fifth and pivoting when you shouldn't"
- "I think you can get in a spot I think where you're building two decks in pack one that seems like a not ideal spot to be in"
- "it's probably going to be very unlikely that you're like green black and then pick five you jump ship and go white red right it'll be it'll be like you're green and you're feeling out whether you're squirrels or frogs"
**Confidence Level:** Medium

### Strategy - Premium Interaction is Key
**Timestamp:** [0:12:30]
**Take:** Premium removal is very important because much of the format's synergy is creature-based. Killing key creatures disrupts opponents' plans significantly.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "similar to otj along with rares being good the premium interaction is very important because so much of the Synergy is tied up in creatures... if you can kill the creatures and break up your opponent's Synergy that's a pretty big Boon to you"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Strategy - Splashing Discouraged
**Timestamp:** [0:12:05], [0:12:20]
**Take:** Splashing is generally not advised due to lack of fixing outside of Green. The best decks are expected to be focused two-color decks.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "the fixing is just not there in this set in my opinion um like outside like colorless fixing is not there like green maybe with heaped Harvest and the manad DOR but outside of green I don't think you get to be like Oh I'm just GNA take this busted rare and it's going in my deck no matter what"
- "I agree and I think you aren't generally supposed to be trying to Splash I think the the best decks are going to be two color Decks that get there"
**Confidence Level:** High

## Color Evaluation

### Green - Top Color
**Timestamp:** [0:16:40], [0:17:45]
**Take:** Green is the strongest color, surpassing initial expectations for White. It's deep at common and uncommon, has many of the best uncommons (including multicolor ones), and its creatures have good stats/rates.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I think after playing with the cards green has surpassed white for me I think I would go green one"
- "Green watsi is just really trying to make up for years of green being terrible and limited"
- "it's really deep at both common and uncommon and it's got a lot of the best uncommons in the format"
- "Green's kind of got the otj thing going on again where like its cards are just a really good rate"
**Confidence Level:** High

### White - Second Best Color
**Timestamp:** [0:16:40], [0:17:05]
**Take:** White is considered the second-best color, strong but perhaps slightly edged out by Green's depth and power.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I think I would go green one white two"
- "I played a lot more with white this this week... I liked you know I like white black white red white green"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Red / Black - Mid Tier
**Timestamp:** [0:16:40], [0:17:05]
**Take:** Red and Black are closely ranked behind Green and White.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "and then red and black in pretty close order after white"
- "Would have had... Black in fourth"
**Confidence Level:** Medium

### Blue - Worst Color
**Timestamp:** [0:16:40], [0:17:05], [0:20:40]
**Take:** Blue is clearly the weakest color. Its commons are considered poor ("atrocious"), and even its good uncommons are narrow compared to other colors' flexible powerhouses.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "and then blue bringing up the rear"
- "the thing I feel strongly about is that blue is the worst color"
- "I don't have any blue cards there because I think Blue's Commons are not good like Commons are atrocious it has some good uncommons but the the commons are bad"
**Confidence Level:** High

## Archetype Predictions

### Tier 1 Archetypes
**Timestamp:** [0:18:10]
**Take:** Green-Black (Squirrels), Blue-Green (Frogs), White-Green (Rabbits), and Black-White (Life Gain) are predicted to be the top-tier archetypes. Red-Green might reach Tier 1 but needs evaluation regarding consistency.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "if we have three tiers I would put three of the green color pairs in tier one green black blue green white green"
- "maybe red green will be there too... I think it maybe lacks a bit of staying power or just figuring out how to get that piece like I think it can be vulnerable to flood"
- "And then the other archetype that I'd put in tier one is black white"
**Confidence Level:** Medium

### Tier 2 Archetypes
**Timestamp:** [0:18:50]
**Take:** Blue-Black (Rats - surprisingly aggro), Red-White (Valiant), Red-Green (Raccoons - if not Tier 1), and Red-Black (Lizards) are placed in Tier 2. Red-Black Lizards and Blue-Black Rats were impressive when they came together.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "tier two I'd put blue black red white red green red black"
- "was very impressed with red black lizards when it came together was very impressed with blue black rats and blue black rats is truly aggro"
**Confidence Level:** Medium

### Tier 3 Archetypes
**Timestamp:** [0:20:15]
**Take:** Blue-Red (Spells) and Blue-White (Flyers?) are predicted to be the weakest archetypes. Blue-Red seems finicky, and Blue-White hasn't been seen much.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "tier three uh blue red and blue white bringing up the rear"
- "I just think that deck's [UR] really finicky"
- "I haven't seen blue white at all yet either"
**Confidence Level:** Medium

### Red-White - Overrated?
**Timestamp:** [0:19:25], [0:19:50]
**Take:** Red-White is not considered Tier 1 initially. Its creatures are small, requiring multiple Valiant triggers just to match the base stats of creatures in colors like Green. There's also an imbalance between Valiant enablers and payoffs.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I think worth noting that red white is not tier one for us going into week one"
- "the cards are so small... your opponent like offsprings their flower foot swordmaster on turn three and they have like a one two and a one one that then they're trying to like trigger Valiant to make their creatures just as large as the green cards are"
- "there's way more ways to trigger Valiant than there are Valiant cards... I just felt like I got tons of ways to Target my creatures I don't have a ton of creatures that care about being targeted"
**Confidence Level:** Medium

### Dominant Colors within Pairs
**Timestamp:** [0:09:05]
**Take:** Within each color pair archetype, one color often feels more dominant in defining the strategy (e.g., Green in UG Frogs/GB Squirrels, White in its aggressive pairs).
**Supporting Statements:**
- "one of the in all of the arc types one of the base colors is much more the dominant color I think like green is much more predominantly squirrels and frogs yes than it is raccoons and rabbits"
- "white is much more predominantly this is such a good take Ben yeah this is great"
**Confidence Level:** Medium

## Card Evaluations & Re-evaluations

*(Note: Includes top commons discussion and individual card re-evaluations)*

### Top Commons (Initial Consensus)
**Timestamp:** [0:21:30]
**Take:** Intrepid Rabbit, Nocturnal Hunger, Take Out the Trash, Baker's Bane Duo, and Head to the Homestead are considered top-tier commons, likely happy first picks. Banishing Light is also a strong, flexible pick.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "we have five cards that we both really really like... Intrepid rabbit... Nocturnal hunger... Take out the trash... Baker's Bane Duo... Head to the homestead"
- "I do think banishing light is probably a card that should be on both of our lists as well... that's a card you can take early and feel good about"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Baker's Bane Duo - Excellent
**Timestamp:** [0:07:45], [0:22:15]
**Take:** This green common Duo (Squirrel Raccoon) is excellent and very impressive in play.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "Baker's ban Duo one in a green that excellent"
- "that card has been very very very impressive agreed"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Glide-Dive Duo - Very Good
**Timestamp:** [0:07:45], [0:23:15]
**Take:** This black common Duo (Rat Lizard) is very good, with the drain being impactful. Happy to first pick it.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I also think the Glidedive Duo is very good... I'm coming around I think that card's good"
- "I'll shout out Glide dive Duo again... I think I'd be happy first picking that"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Cash Grab - Excellent (in GB)
**Timestamp:** [0:22:40]
**Take:** Excellent common for the Green-Black deck, enabling the archetype and fueling the graveyard. Playable elsewhere but shines in GB.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "cash crab is excellent in green black I think it is mostly a green black only card but it is the card that makes that deck tick"
- "cash grab is just a really good card I like it more than I like stupid whatever from Modern Horizons 3 malevolent Rumble"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Heaped Harvest - Amazing (in GB)
**Timestamp:** [0:23:25]
**Take:** Amazing common artifact food in Green-Black, providing forage triggers, fixing, ramp, and enabling splashes.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "heaped Harvest has also been amazing... card's awesome in squirrels because it gives you a forage trigger it just helps you hit your land drops"
- "plus also enables splashing and cool stuff for other just Bas green decks"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Poly-Wallop - Strong (in UG)
**Timestamp:** [0:24:05]
**Take:** Strong green common removal, especially in UG Frogs (B+ level), but playable in other green decks with even one frog. Key common payoff for an archetype, unlike Blue's commons.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "as long as this card is going late frogs is going to be very difficult to deal with"
- "Po Wallop is a b like a B+ in a frog's deck and and playable in other Decks that just might have a random frog"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Carrot Cake - Divisive (Ben Low, Ethan High)
**Timestamp:** [0:23:15]
**Take:** Ethan remains high on Carrot Cake, while Ben thinks it's "too small ball for the format" as a white card (would be better in green due to forage).
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I'm still still a huge carrot cake Stan at this point"
- "I don't think it's a good card I think it's too small ball for the format"
**Confidence Level:** Low (Split Decision)

### Sinister Monolith - Too Slow
**Timestamp:** [0:24:45]
**Take:** This black artifact was too slow in Black-White life gain decks. Evaluation lowered.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "two slow in black white just basically... that didn't get there so not a huge fan of the monolith"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Scales of Shale - Incredible (in RB)
**Timestamp:** [0:25:10]
**Take:** This black instant is incredibly powerful ("a beating") in Red-Black Lizards. It's an A-level card in that deck that other decks don't want, making it easy to pick up late. Makes racing impossible.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "this card is a beating I had four of them in a red black deck during early access and they were just incredible"
- "it's like an A in your deck and no other deck wants it that's a just sick spot to be in"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Starscape Cleric - Impressive (in BW)
**Timestamp:** [0:25:55]
**Take:** This black uncommon flyer plays like Blood Artist in the BW life gain deck, providing a potent, evasive drain effect that ends games quickly. The "can't block" clause is not a major drawback. It's a good payoff, though not necessarily a reason to force the archetype.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "this card I mean it's only in black white in in my mind... it just it plays out like blood artist in a sacrifice deck in the Life gain deck"
- "it just ends the game really quickly"
- "I don't think it's a reason to draft the deck... I feel like it's a card you can get late and then you go oh cool I can do the thing"
**Confidence Level:** Medium

### Persistent Marsh Stalker - Reason to Draft UB
**Timestamp:** [0:27:20]
**Take:** This black uncommon is likely the best payoff for Blue-Black Rats and a legitimate reason to draft the archetype.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "that is I think the best blue black uncommon rats payoff to me like that's the reason to get into blue black"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Blacksmith's Talent - Underrated / Performed Well
**Timestamp:** [0:28:00]
**Take:** This red class enchantment performed much better than expected. It curves well, provides free equip triggers (Valiant synergy), and grants double strike/haste at level 3, making it hard to deal with.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I mean this card just like really performed well and it's like very hard to deal with"
- "it curves so nicely with itself... it it's just a really smooth thing"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Steam Path Charger - Impressive
**Timestamp:** [0:29:20]
**Take:** This red common 2/1 impressed by triggering damage-matters effects (Lizards) while still trading effectively. Also good in RG for enabling Expend 4.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "yeah this card impressed me uh the the fact that it can trigger your damage matters stuff in lizards while still trading right"
- "secondarily pretty darn good in red green because your two drop has the option to trigger expend four"
**Confidence Level:** Medium

### Clifftop Lookout - Overrated / Possibly Bad
**Timestamp:** [0:30:15]
**Take:** This green uncommon might be bad. The body is very small (1/1 reach), and while it ramps, it feels less impactful than initially thought, maybe not even good in its intended Frogs deck. Worse than Heaped Harvest.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "you say you think this card might be bad I do agree it's a very small body... probably just less good than we thought it was"
- "I don't think you're playing this in a non frog deck and I don't even think it's that good in frogs like I think this card might just be I hate to use it but I think this might be bad"
- "worse than heaped Harvest I think which would not have been apparent to me initially"
**Confidence Level:** Medium (Ben thinks bad, Ethan thinks playable C)

### Stocking the Pantry - Real (Niche)
**Timestamp:** [0:31:25]
**Take:** This green enchantment build-around is a real card in dedicated +1/+1 counter decks (Frogs, Squirrels), providing card draw. It's niche and taken late, but effective when the deck supports it.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I think this card is real... I don't think it's great or high nobody else is gonna want it right yeah either your deck does the thing and you will play a stocking the pantry"
**Confidence Level:** Medium

### Three-Tree Mascot - Bad
**Timestamp:** [0:32:45]
**Take:** This changeling is considered bad.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I have not I think that card's really bad this card's bad"
**Confidence Level:** High

### 2-Mana 2/1s - Weak Stat Line
**Timestamp:** [0:32:55]
**Take:** Two mana for a 2/1 is generally a poor stat line in this format due to prevalent 1/3s and 1/1 tokens.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I think 21 for two Mana is a tough stat line to get behind in the format because there's a lot of 13s and there's one- one tokens running around"
**Confidence Level:** Medium

### AgoutÃ­ Blade Assassin - Bad
**Timestamp:** [0:33:30]
**Take:** This black common 1/3 attacker is bad and likely replacement level. It doesn't attack well past the early turns and trades poorly compared to 2/1s.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I did not this basically doesn't have attacks after like turn two or three... I think this is just replacement level"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Tree-Guard Duo - Good / Underrated Common?
**Timestamp:** [0:34:45]
**Take:** This green common Duo (Frog Rabbit) is quite good and potentially belongs in the top 10 commons list. It provides a significant board impact and is desirable in UG, RG, and GW.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I also like this card this might be a this might belong in our top 10 honestly"
- "I think in green blue green red and green white I think you're happy with this"
**Confidence Level:** Medium

### Fireglass Mentor - Divisive (Ethan High, Ben Low)
**Timestamp:** [0:35:15]
**Take:** Ethan is high on this RB uncommon, seeing it as a potent card advantage engine when enabled (especially with damage outside combat). Ben is low, citing the weak 2/1 body and the difficulty of triggering it while having mana to cast the exiled card.
**Supporting Statements:**
- Ethan: "it's been very impressive from opponents... if you can figure out how to enable it and have Mana open it does really give you a lot of card selection"
- Ben: "I don't like this card that much I'm again I'm pretty down on two Mana 21es... triggering this wasn't hard triggering this plus having Mana to cast the stuff was was hard"
**Confidence Level:** Low (Split Decision)

### Otter-Ball Antics - Bad
**Timestamp:** [0:37:20]
**Take:** This blue sorcery is underwhelming and feels too small-impact ("real small ball"). Seems like a card you only want if you can cast it for free via mill/loot.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "which just pretty underwhelmed by this it does just feels real small to spend two Mana for a one- one... bad right like this bad yeah I agree"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Dire Down Draft - Fine, Not Premium
**Timestamp:** [0:38:00]
**Take:** This blue instant is acceptable removal but not premium. It's awkward against ETB effects and expensive (4 mana) when trying to be tempo-positive.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "this is fine but it's not premium... this card gets awkward really quickly"
- "four Mana interact when you're like trying to be the Beatdown is a big ask"
**Confidence Level:** Medium

### Flower-Foot Swordmaster - Understated / Too Much Work
**Timestamp:** [0:38:40]
**Take:** This white common is understated compared to other threats and requires too much work (multiple Valiant triggers) to reach a relevant size. Evaluation lowered.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "again this like just really understated compared to most things in the format"
- "just so much has to go how much work are you doing where where other decks just don't have to do that work"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Daring Wave Rider - Expensive / Underwhelming
**Timestamp:** [0:39:15]
**Take:** This blue rare is too expensive (4UU) and doesn't do enough to pull you into Blue-Red or catch you up from behind. Significantly worse than Wix Patrol.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "this is a little on the expensive side for it to really pull you into blue red... this isn't quite good enough to catch you up"
- "Wix Patrol is way better than daring Wave Rider"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Eddy-Mark Crab - Real Deal Payoff
**Timestamp:** [0:40:00]
**Take:** This blue uncommon flash creature is a powerful spells payoff, potentially a reason to draft UR or UB. It's intrinsically powerful, swingy on board, and doesn't require excessive build-around.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "this is a real deal as far as spells payoffs go like this is if you're going to drop blue red should be for Eddie MK crab"
- "I think this is just an intrinsically very powerful card... I don't think you have to do that much work for this to be a very good card"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Shoreline Looter - Very Good
**Timestamp:** [0:41:45]
**Take:** This blue uncommon is a very good threat and source of card selection, especially in UB but playable in most blue decks. The unblockable ability combined with looting (and later card advantage) makes it a must-kill threat once threshold is active.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "this is a very good threat very good card selection this is best in blue black but I think you can play it in most blue decks"
- "once this is turned on it must be killed and it being unblockable is just randomly really great"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Bone Crier Overseer - Incredible (in GB)
**Timestamp:** [0:42:50]
**Take:** This black uncommon one-drop is incredible in Green-Black Squirrels. It enables early Cash Grab, curves perfectly, and provides card draw by sacrificing *any* food, not just via foraging.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "this card is incredible... it's black green only but it is again excellent in black green"
- "you don't actually have to forage to be able tap it like you can just sack a food that's laying around... very very very strong"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Stargaze - Potential Control Piece
**Timestamp:** [0:43:50]
**Take:** This black uncommon sorcery could be an important card for slower Black control decks (BG, UB, maybe BW). It helps refuel against flood/running out of gas and fuels graveyard strategies, though it requires careful deckbuilding and isn't a high pick.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I think this might actually be a card... I think you can run out of gas or flood in the format... I think you have time to assuming you affect the board then play a stargaze late"
- "assuming you understand control deck building and drafting stargaze could be an important piece of those types of decks"
**Confidence Level:** Medium

### Wix Patrol - Amazing
**Timestamp:** [0:45:05]
**Take:** This black uncommon is amazing and should go in every black deck. It requires no work, provides removal and graveyard fuel, and benefits from recursion. Much better than Daring Wave Rider.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "this one is amazing yeah this you just put in every black deck it takes no work"
- "Wix Patrol is way better than daring Wave Rider yeah I buy it"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Hunter's Talent - Banger Uncommon
**Timestamp:** [0:45:35]
**Take:** This green uncommon class is incredibly strong ("banger"), essentially a Rabid Bite with massive upside (counters, trample). Findable with Cash Grab.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "which green just has so many Banger uncommons the Moose Hunter's Talent"
- "it's rabid bite with extreme upside yeah so good"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Lily-Pad Splash Mentor - Key Frog Payoff
**Timestamp:** [0:46:25]
**Take:** This UG uncommon is very good and a key reason the Frogs archetype is strong. It helps stall the board and then inevitably wins board stalls with its repeatable flicker ability.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "this one's good it's good I mean this is the reason frogs is great right"
- "this just wins any board stall quite easily and frogs are very good at stalling out the board"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Villages (Manlands) - Irrelevant / Low Impact
**Timestamp:** [0:47:00]
**Take:** The common manlands ("Villages") don't seem to matter much in draft or deckbuilding. The red one is perhaps the best, but none are high picks, and the activation restrictions (especially on the black one) are real costs.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "they just don't matter I don't think any of them matter"
- "Irrelevant in the sense that you don't care about whether or not you end up with them during the draft like you're only taking them in spots where it's free to take them"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Star-Forged Sword - Real Card / Underrated?
**Timestamp:** [0:47:55]
**Take:** This uncommon equipment might be underrated ("a real card"). The +3/+3 boost is significant in a format where stats matter, synergizing well with evasion, vigilance, and trample. Might be worth picking higher than initially assumed.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "this makes your things huge and stats do matter I think in this format"
- "star Forge sword I think is is a real card in the format okay again you you don't have ever have to like take it highly right I think it might be good interesting I think it might be worth picking"
**Confidence Level:** Medium

### Patchwork Banner - Very Strong / Potentially First Pickable?
**Timestamp:** [0:48:45]
**Take:** This uncommon artifact anthem/mana rock is very strong, potentially oppressively so ("adding insult to injury") in the already good synergistic decks. Its flexibility (goes in any successful two-color creature-type deck) might even make it worth first picking. Best in go-wide White decks.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I actually kind of hate that this is in the format because like you're only playing this in a two-color deck that got there and those decks are already good"
- "is this a card worth first picking because like all you're trying to do is find the open deck... maybe you're kind selling me on it"
- "certainly a very strong card"
**Confidence Level:** Medium
