Okay, here is the retrospective analysis of the Bloomburrow Limited format based on the provided transcript from the Lords of Limited podcast.

## Bloomburrow Retrospective: Lords of Limited "50 Takes" Send-Off

This analysis summarizes the key retrospective evaluations and lessons learned about the Magic: The Gathering set *Bloomburrow* as discussed by Ben and Ethan in their "50 Takes in 50 Minutes" episode. The discussion reflects on their experiences after drafting and playing the format extensively since its release.

---

## Overall Format & Set Feel

### Bloomburrow - Core Set with Synergy
**Timestamp:** 0:08:40
**Current Evaluation:** The set felt like a simpler "core set" with less text complexity but featured very clear, straightforward synergies within archetypes (e.g., Red-Black Lizards). However, raw card quality often trumped synergy, and the high synergy potential could exacerbate feel-bads when opponents assembled perfectly synergistic decks due to pack distribution.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted, but the description implies a recognized simplicity combined with obvious synergy paths.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "bloomo is best summarized as a core set with Synergy"
- "it definitely felt like there was a concerted effort to put less text on cards to me in this format"
- "the Synergy was very clear like it was because you know as a new person if you're sitting down to play Magic and you want to draft red black and you take the cards that say lizards like you're going to end up with a good deck"
- "yeah Synergy was good I think like raw card quality trumped Synergy in this format for me"
- "the Synergy Juiced up good draft slots artificially because it was so present"
**Key Insights:** Bloomburrow combined simplicity with clear synergistic lanes, though raw power remained crucial. The strong synergy focus could lead to swingy outcomes based on draft seat.

### Format Structure - Two-Color Pairs, Like Guilds
**Timestamp:** 0:10:25
**Current Evaluation:** The format strongly resembled a "Guild set" structure where all 10 two-color pairs felt viable, although clear power level tiers existed among them. This breadth was appreciated.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "bloomo was a two color pair format it did almost feel like a guild set"
- "this felt like all 10 were viable"
- "I do think everything was viable to an extent not all created equal but everything viable for sure"
- "probably the top three archetypes Gap next four archetypes Gap last three archetypes something like that but certainly everything viable"
**Key Insights:** All 10 color pairs were playable, offering breadth, but distinct power tiers separated the best from the rest.

### Archetype Design - Straightforward, Little Crossover
**Timestamp:** 0:11:30
**Current Evaluation:** Archetypes were highly distinct with minimal synergistic overlap. This meant finding a lane early was crucial, and picks often became obvious within that lane, leading to earlier color commitments than usual. Green and Black might have allowed staying mono-color longer.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "each color pair in bloomo was straightforward and synergistic without much crossover Synergy between archetypes"
- "really kind of felt like once you found your lane... there was no deviating and you generally knew which card you were picking out of the pack every pack"
- "I do think it was a little earlier [locking in colors] in this format because uh the there were so many secret gold cards as well"
**Key Insights:** Strong archetypal lanes with little cross-pollination encouraged early commitment and rewarded finding the open colors.

### Format Speed & Feel - Grindy Despite Early Plays
**Timestamp:** 0:27:15
**Current Evaluation:** While getting on board early (especially with a two-drop) was crucial for tempo, synergy, and hand-sculpting, the format often felt grindy rather than purely aggressive. Games frequently went long if both players established a board presence, requiring decks to handle both fast starts and late-game attrition. Perception of speed varied.
**Initial Expectations:** Some early metrics suggested a fast format, but playing experience often felt slower/grindier.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "bloomo rewarded getting on board early to snowball with Synergy and aggression"
- "you had to be spending your man in the early turns like it was closer to you really wanted to be playing a two drop than not"
- "did you feel like this format was aggressive cuz I don't I... felt like my games were grindy a lot of the time"
- "the format just asked for you to account for so many different types of games without providing you very Dynamic cards"
**Key Insights:** Early board presence was vital, but games often devolved into grinds, demanding deck versatility. The format's perceived speed was complex.

### Food's Impact - Hostile to Pure Aggro
**Timestamp:** 0:29:25
**Current Evaluation:** The prevalence of Food tokens and life gain in top archetypes (GB, GW, UG, BW) made the environment hostile to aggressive decks lacking late-game plans. Red-Black was a notable exception due to its card advantage engines and reach.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "the prevalence of food in the top archetypes made the format hostile to aggro without the ability to compete in the late game"
- "black green squirrels just crushed aggro decks"
- "those top archetypes were all food archetypes which is which is probably also why... stuff like red white struggled a bit"
- "I do think red black was an exception... fireglass Mentor as The Uncommon gave enough card advantage... it could really compete in the late game"
**Key Insights:** Food mechanics significantly suppressed pure aggro strategies, forcing aggressive decks to incorporate resilience or reach.

### Sealed Format - Card Advantage War
**Timestamp:** 0:52:10
**Current Evaluation:** Bloomburrow Sealed was primarily a battle of card advantage. Prioritizing card draw, filtering, value engines, and removal was key.
**Initial Expectations:** Not contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "sealed was a card Advantage War"
- "get those get those mind Spirals and psychic whs and banditstalents in"
**Key Insights:** The Sealed format emphasized grinding value and accumulating card advantage over synergistic aggression.

### Overall Set Rating - Fine, Lacks Longevity
**Timestamp:** 1:00:40
**Current Evaluation:** Considered a great introductory set due to its simplicity and clear synergies, but ultimately lacked depth and replayability ("legs") for experienced players. Rated as "Fine" (Ben) to "Fine minus" / "Below average" (Ethan). Little desire to revisit via flashbacks.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted, but the final verdict is lukewarm.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "bloomo is a great introductory set but it doesn't have much legs beyond that"
- "I definitely will feel fine if I never do another bloomo draft and I thought this format was fine" (Ben)
- "this format was fine minus for me this was I I I think below average overall" (Ethan)
**Key Insights:** Functional and beginner-friendly, but lacked the complexity and long-term engagement sought by the hosts.

## Mechanic Evaluations

### Forage - Most Powerful Mechanic
**Timestamp:** 0:14:30
**Current Evaluation:** Forage emerged as the format's most powerful mechanic, significantly boosting Green's strength. Enabling it was easier than anticipated, largely thanks to abundant Food tokens and food-like cards mitigating graveyard tension. It succeeded where similar LCI mechanics failed.
**Initial Expectations:** Was a "question mark," with concerns about enabling costs and tension with Threshold. Looked like LCI's graveyard mechanics which "fell totally flat."
**Supporting Statements:**
- "forage was the most powerful mechanic in the format which bolstered Green in power and Synergy"
- "I definitely felt like forage was a bit of a question mark going into the set"
- "the food tokens running around... really gave you the like the juice for those cards cuz you didn't have to worry about using your graveyard as a resource"
- "this format looked a lot like LCI to me during preview season and LCI the black green stuff fell totally flat... this to be LCI 2.0 and it was not nothing further from the truth"
**Key Insights:** Forage overperformed significantly, becoming a cornerstone of Green's dominance, fueled by the format's food subtheme.

### Offspring - Kicker-esque, Minor Impact
**Timestamp:** 0:15:50
**Current Evaluation:** Played out adequately as a kicker-like bonus but didn't fundamentally alter card evaluation or the format's dynamics. Most relevant on Intrepid Rabbit. The 1/1 tokens generated were often outclassed by Green's larger creatures.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "Offspring played out well as a kickeresque mechanic but it didn't fundamentally change the format"
- "mattered most in green W most with Intrepid rabbit"
- "it didn't really change anything about cars like how you evaluated things right"
- "one one tokens of things weren't so good because they couldn't tussle in that way [against Green]"
**Key Insights:** A minor value mechanic that rarely drove decisions or defined archetypes.

### Gift - Largely Irrelevant
**Timestamp:** 0:16:55
**Current Evaluation:** Failed to add meaningful decisions or complexity as initially hoped. Generally, players avoided gifting if possible. Longstock Brawl was a rare case where gifting could be correct. The format would have been mostly unchanged without it.
**Initial Expectations:** Hype about adding "layers" and "decisions" did not materialize.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "gift largely irrelevant as a mechanic"
- "it was so everyone was like well it adds layers it adds decisions like kind of but you generally hoped to not have to gift"
- "ultimately gift could have not existed and the format would have been largely the same"
**Key Insights:** Gift underdelivered on its potential complexity, ending up as a mostly negligible mechanic.

### Valiant - Fell Flat, A "Big Miss"
**Timestamp:** 0:18:25
**Current Evaluation:** Valiant significantly underperformed ("big Miss"). Strategies based on growing small creatures (Red-White) proved inferior to Green's naturally large creatures. The mechanic needed uncommon/rare support (Mabel, Talents) and wasn't consistently size-boosting (e.g., Mouse Trapper).
**Initial Expectations:** Implied higher hopes, now viewed as a failure.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "Valiant man what a big Miss for us Valiant fell flat as a mechanic"
- "this again goes back two green creatures large red White's creatures small"
- "if you had your choice... do you want to start with things that grow to the size of Green's creatures or are the size of green creatures you would choose the latter"
- "it needed higher Rarity cards it certainly was not there at common"
- "Mouse Trapper big Miss for me"
**Key Insights:** Valiant was ineffective due to Green's dominance in creature sizing, making incremental growth strategies less viable.

### Expend - Simple, Done Well
**Timestamp:** 0:19:40
**Current Evaluation:** A straightforward mechanic that functioned well. Provided a nice bonus without drastically changing drafts or the format, though it occasionally created small sequencing puzzles. "About as face up as a mechanic could be."
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "expend was a simple mechanic done well it didn't really change the format or how you drafted but it was just a nice bonus on cards"
- "it definitely like there was a little bit of a puzzle there with your your hand"
**Key Insights:** A simple, functional mechanic adding minor value and occasional decision points.

### Threshold - Best as Aggro/Tempo
**Timestamp:** 0:20:30
**Current Evaluation:** Played out most effectively in aggressive tempo decks (like Blue-Black Rats), contrary to initial feelings it might be a control mechanic. The goal was to apply pressure and use threshold payoffs to close the game. Cards like Persistent Marsh Stalker were key, while slower value cards like Mind Whisker were less aligned with the deck's goals.
**Initial Expectations:** Initial resistance, viewing it as a potential control mechanic.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "threshold played out best as an aggro Tempo deck"
- "I personally felt resistant to that early I was like well but it's but threshold that's a control mechanic... No that's not what you're trying to do you are trying to beat down"
- "persistent Mar stalker was just like... this is what the deck is trying to do rats aggro"
- "Mind whisker... that's not what the deck is trying to do"
**Key Insights:** Threshold's optimal use was in aggressive strategies, subverting typical graveyard-matters expectations. Card evaluation needed to align with this tempo plan.

### Talents Cycle - Huge Win, Format Gem
**Timestamp:** 0:21:40
**Current Evaluation:** The Talent cycle was a major success and a highlight ("gem") of the format. Almost all Talents significantly overperformed initial expectations, becoming memorable and powerful build-arounds or value engines.
**Initial Expectations:** Their impact was underestimated.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "the talent were a huge win on the mechanics list huge"
- "if we're reaching for what gems the format had to offer I think the talents were what the format had to offer"
- "almost all the talents overperformed overperformed to vastly overperformed my expectations"
- "if somebody says bloomo I think the thing I will remember about bloomo is the talents"
**Key Insights:** Talents were a standout positive design, proving much more powerful and format-defining than anticipated.

## Color Pair & Archetype Performance

### Color Power Rankings
**Timestamp:** 0:22:55
**Current Evaluation:** 1. Green (dominant), 2. Black, 3. White, 4. Blue (late riser), 5. Red. Clear tiers existed: Green >> Black/White >> Blue/Red.
**Initial Expectations:** Blue's rise to 4th was noted as an "upset."
**Supporting Statements:**
- "first green in second black Third Place White fourth place upset blue... fifth bringing up the rear red"
- "I think there's for me it's green Gap black white Gap blue red"
**Key Insights:** Green stood far above the rest, with distinct power tiers separating the other colors. Blue improved its standing over the format's lifespan.

### Green - The Best Color ("Donatello")
**Timestamp:** 0:12:55
**Current Evaluation:** Green was unequivocally the best color. It possessed superior inherent synergy, raw power, efficient creatures ("rate"), and excellent removal across all its archetypes. Compared to Donatello from TMNT - the best by far.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted, but its dominance is heavily emphasized retrospectively.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "green was the best color because it had self-contained Synergy and Power in green across all the green archetypes"
- "why does it do all the things why does it have the most inherent Synergy and the best rate plus it gets Great Removal like it just did all the things"
- "as a static thing green is unarguably the most powerful color"
**Key Insights:** Green's combination of synergistic power, efficient threats, and strong removal made it the format's dominant color.

### Blue - Undrafted Late, Became Stronger
**Timestamp:** 0:23:30
**Current Evaluation:** Blue became underdrafted towards the end of the format, making it a good strategic position. This allowed access to late, powerful uncommons (Light Shell Duo) and rares (Drayport Mage). While commons were weak, the uncommons carried the color when it was open. Blue-Black emerged as a late-format favorite deck.
**Initial Expectations:** Implied Blue was initially weaker or less popular.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "blue was UN drafted near the end of the format"
- "I'm gonna guess blue is gonna be underdrafted"
- "it's Commons leave a little bit to be desired but... it's uncommons like when you figured out what you were trying to do and blue being open its uncommons delivered"
- "blue black probably a late stage sleeper favorite of both of ours"
**Key Insights:** Metagame shifts made Blue viable later on, rewarding drafters who recognized its openness, primarily leveraging strong uncommons.

### Archetype Power Rankings
**Timestamp:** 0:24:20
**Current Evaluation:**
1.  Green-Black Squirrels (GB)
2.  Green-White Rabbits (GW)
3.  Blue-Green Frogs (UG)
4.  Red-Black Lizards (RB)
5.  Blue-Black Rats (UB)
6.  Black-White Bats (BW) - *Hosts disagreed slightly, Ethan ranked higher*
7.  Red-Green Raccoons (RG)
8.  Red-White Mice (RW)
9.  Blue-Red Otters (UR)
10. Blue-White Birds (UW) - *Rarely drafted*
**Retrospective Notes:** Green decks dominated the top. RB was consistently strong and perhaps initially underrated (by Ben). BW felt oppressive with life gain but maybe less resilient than RB/UB. UW was largely absent from draft.
**Supporting Statements:**
- [Ranking list provided]
- "black white bats so low we had we had a little pre-show jousting over over black white bats"
- "I still despite my efforts I think I disrespected red black lizards up until the end of the format"
- "red black was just so consistently good at forcing the opponent into playing the type of game it wanted to play"
- "facing black white bats... just feeling like you never... started the game at 28 life I can never win"
**Key Insights:** Clear hierarchy with Green-based decks at the top. RB proved a consistent performer. BW was powerful but potentially fragile. UW was not a real draft archetype.

### Growing Creatures vs. Green - A Losing Battle
**Timestamp:** 0:44:20
**Current Evaluation:** Strategies relying on growing smaller creatures (common in RW, UR) were fundamentally disadvantaged against Green's naturally larger threats. Colorless tools like Patchwork Banner became important for non-Green decks to compete on board presence and value.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "trying to grow your creatures to the Natural size of greens creatures was a losing battle looking at you red white and blue red"
- "Patchwork Banner like was a real need you needed that card in non- green decks I think to be able to compete"
**Key Insights:** Green's baseline creature size warped the format, invalidating incremental growth strategies and increasing the value of universal equalizers.

## Card Reassessments

### Innkeeper's Talent & Hunter's Talent - Broken
**Timestamp:** 0:22:20
**Current Evaluation:** These two Talents were deemed "broken" and too powerful for Limited. Hunter's Talent (uncommon) was particularly egregious, being close in power level to the rare Innkeeper's Talent and appearing much more frequently.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly stated, but the "broken" label implies they exceeded acceptable power levels.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "inkeeper talent and Hunter talent were broken I think a little too broken for Limited"
- "Hunter's Talent is also really hard to beat and is an uncommon they're they're closer in power level than you would think"
**Key Insights:** These two cards warped gameplay due to sheer power, especially the uncommon Hunter's Talent.

### Duo Cycle - Uneven Power Levels
**Timestamp:** 0:34:15
**Current Evaluation:** Massive power disparity within the cycle.
- **Top Tier (4s/4+):** Baker's Bane Duo (G), Tree Guard Duo (G), Dagger-Fang Duo (UB), Light Shell Duo (U), Glide-Dive Duo (B - Ben rated lower).
- **Low Tier (1s/0s):** Life-Creed Duo (W), Sky-Skipper Duo (UW), Roughshot Duo (R), Kindle Spark Duo (R), Brave-Kin Duo (GW - "zero").
Light Shell Duo was a major overperformer. Dagger-Fang Duo was potentially underrated initially. The drop-off after the top 5 was severe.
**Initial Expectations:** Light Shell Duo rose significantly. Red/White duos likely underperformed expectations.
**Supporting Statements:**
- [Ranking discussed with grades]
- "I didn't play enough dagger Fang Duos I think I didn't pick this card quite highly enough"
- "light shell Duo like where did it come from like so good"
- "such a huge a startling Cliff like life Creed Duo is a one... Skys Skipper on down is just zeros"
**Key Insights:** The Duo cycle was extremely unbalanced, with Green, Blue, and Black variants being strong playables while others were marginal to unplayable. Light Shell Duo was a standout riser.

### Crumb and Get It - "Crumbelievable" Trick
**Timestamp:** 0:36:40
**Current Evaluation:** An incredibly powerful and difficult-to-play-around combat trick. Even when anticipated, it often led to blowouts.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted, but recognized as a top-tier trick.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "crumb and get it was crumbelievable"
- "it was just impossible to play around this card like you could Peg your opponents for Crum and get it and it was crumbing and getting you"
**Key Insights:** One of the format's most impactful and game-swinging common combat tricks.

### Top Commons Reassessment
**Timestamp:** 0:38:05
**Current Evaluation:**
- White: Intrepid Rabbit (over Carrot Cake, presented as a potential "upset")
- Blue: Light Shell Duo
- Black: Savers
- Red: Take Out the Trash
- Green: Baker's Bane Duo (preferred over Cash Grab P1P1)
**Initial Expectations:** Intrepid Rabbit's placement over Carrot Cake was highlighted as potentially controversial or unexpected.
**Supporting Statements:**
- [Lists the commons]
- "perhaps the biggest upset of the whole episode Intrepid rabbit... it's got to be Intrepid rabbit over carrot cake"
- "one pick one I'm always taking the baker Bane [over Cash Grab]"
**Key Insights:** Solidified the best common in each color, with White having a notable point of discussion.

### Thought-Stalker Warlock - Lived Up to Hype
**Timestamp:** 0:39:00
**Current Evaluation:** Delivered on its preview season hype as a broken rare. Consistently powerful throughout the format.
**Initial Expectations:** Hyped as broken.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "thought-stalker warlock was the LeBron James of bloomo"
- "this card was hyped up during preview season as broken and it delivered all format long"
**Key Insights:** A rare that fully met its high power level expectations.

### Downwind Ambusher - Small Tweak, Big Impact
**Timestamp:** 0:39:40
**Current Evaluation:** The addition of the -1/-1 clause transformed this card from niche playable into one of the better uncommons, highlighting how small design changes can significantly alter power level.
**Initial Expectations:** Implied it looked niche initially.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "adding the minus one minus SW Claus to downwind ambusher pushed it from Niche playable to one of the better uncommons"
- "checking out those small tweaks... can have big power level changes"
**Key Insights:** Demonstrates the importance of evaluating minor text changes on familiar effects.

### The Village Lands - A Trap
**Timestamp:** 0:40:15
**Current Evaluation:** These dual lands were generally detrimental. The potential upside of activation was rare and minor compared to the significant downside of color screw or tempo loss. Playing basics was almost always better.
**Initial Expectations:** Tempting to include for fixing/upside.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "The Villages are a trap it's a trap don't put these in your deck"
- "the upside is minor advantage and the downside is game losing"
- "as I I learned very early on... I can't [activate Lily-Splash Mentor] because this isn't actually an island"
- "just you're just better off never playing them"
**Key Insights:** The opportunity cost and inconsistency of the Village lands outweighed their potential benefits.

### Flametongue Kavu Effects (Wix Patrol, Hivespine Wolverine) - Excellent
**Timestamp:** 0:41:30
**Current Evaluation:** Creatures with ETB removal/destruction effects were premium. Hivespine Wolverine was particularly strong in Sealed due to its ability to destroy Talents and other non-creature permanents, though Ben was slightly less impressed than Ethan.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted, but their power was confirmed.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "flametongue Cavo are good Wix Patrolexcellent HP Spy and Wolverine also so good and just a house in sealed"
- "definitely a house and seal being able to blow up talents is really important"
**Key Insights:** ETB value creatures, especially versatile ones, were highly impactful, particularly in Sealed.

### Fountainport Bell - Golden Egg Award Winner
**Timestamp:** 0:47:35
**Current Evaluation:** Massively overperformed initial low expectations ("stinks," "D"). Became a valuable utility piece ("Golden Egg") in almost any deck due to being colorless fixing, enabling forage/threshold, triggering prowess, and providing a mana sink. A close approximation to Carrot Cake/Cash Grab's function.
**Initial Expectations:** Very low; Ben had "horrible experiences" early on.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "the golden egg award for bloomo goes to Fountain Port Bell"
- "from a card that I was like this card stinks it's a d... too I totally agree"
- "it's colorless it's a third of a forage it's a seventh of your threshold all it triggers your prowess stuff as a land like all that adds up"
- "this might be the most I've ever come up on a golden egg Award winner"
**Key Insights:** A utility land whose synergistic contributions across multiple mechanics made it far better than it initially appeared.

### Light Shell Duo - Imperial Oath Award Winner
**Timestamp:** 0:48:40
**Current Evaluation:** The quintessential "clunky looking overperformer." Its evaluation rose dramatically over the format as its impact (large body + Surveil 2) became clear.
**Initial Expectations:** Looked clunky and unimpressive.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "the Imperial oath award for clunky looking over performer goes to got to be light shell Duo"
- "I definitely like lumped it in with other things but this is true like cream with a crop Cut Above the Rest this card's great"
**Key Insights:** A prime example of a card whose practical strength significantly exceeded its initial visual or textual assessment.

### Oppressive Rares List
**Timestamp:** 0:49:05
**Current Evaluation:** Identified several rares as oppressive and format-warping: Season of Loss, Mahait's Feathers, Oakhaven Greenhell, Innkeeper's Talent, Valley Quest Caller. These cards often decided games on their own.
**Initial Expectations:** Not contrasted, just identified as problematic in retrospect.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "my list of oppressive rares that will not be missed"
- [Lists the rares]
- "Valley Quest caller... it does it all it does it all for two Mana"
**Key Insights:** Certain rares were powerful to the point of being detrimental to gameplay balance.

### Eddie Mark Crab & Daring Wave Rider - Fell Flat
**Timestamp:** 0:50:20
**Current Evaluation:** These potentially interesting Blue cards underperformed significantly, seen as casualties of the format's imbalance (dominant Green, underdeveloped Blue).
**Initial Expectations:** Implied they might have been expected to perform better.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "pour one out for Eddie MK crab and daring Wave Rider"
- "I think this format was out of balance as evidenced by these cards falling flat"
- "unfortunate casualties of bloomo pushing green quite a bit and and blue not quite coming together"
**Key Insights:** Card viability is heavily dependent on the surrounding metagame and archetype support.

### Frilled Sparkshooter - Has Reach!
**Timestamp:** 0:50:50
**Current Evaluation:** Surprise! The card has reach, which caught Ben off guard on MTGO. The keyword felt thematically inconsistent with its aggressive stats and menace.
**Initial Expectations:** Did not anticipate reach.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "frilled spark shooter has reach yeah I played enough on mtgo to have gotten got"
- "why does this have like... a blocking mechanic on it that doesn't make any sense to me"
**Key Insights:** Always read the cards carefully; unexpected keywords can lead to blowouts.

### Patchwork Banner - Flexible Early Pick
**Timestamp:** 0:51:20
**Current Evaluation:** A flexible colorless card that rewarded finding the open lane. Initially underestimated as an early pick, but realized it's strong to take early as it fits well into any successful deck, particularly helping non-Green decks compete.
**Initial Expectations:** Underestimated its flexibility and value as an early pick.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "Patchwork Banner was a flexible early pick that rewarded you for finding the open Lane"
- "an un something I didn't Peg early in the format that I then realized I was like oh you can just take this early"
- "no you can just take it and then whatever of those 10 decks you get into then this will be good"
**Key Insights:** Good colorless cards that fit multiple strategies are valuable early picks, offering flexibility.

### Bumbleflower Sharp-Shoot > Early Winter
**Timestamp:** 0:52:25
**Current Evaluation:** The sorcery-speed removal spell that creates a Food token (Bumbleflower Sharp-Shoot) was ultimately better than the instant-speed removal (Early Winter). The value of two permanents entering the battlefield and potential synergies outweighed the instant speed interaction.
**Initial Expectations:** Likely valued Early Winter's instant speed more initially.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "bumbleflower share poot is better than early winter"
- "I saw bumbleflower sharp poot and I was like huh wonder if you're better... well you work with this oh you work with this oh you work with that all right get out of here early winter"
- "I don't care about instant speed I want I want two permanence hitting the battlefield"
**Key Insights:** Evaluating removal requires considering synergy and board impact alongside speed and efficiency.

### Keen-Eyed Curator - Oppressive Graveyard Hate
**Timestamp:** 0:53:25
**Current Evaluation:** This card was oppressive not just for being a large threat, but for incidentally hosing threshold and forage strategies (especially Blue-Black) very effectively.
**Initial Expectations:** Looked like a solid Green threat, but the degree of graveyard hate wasn't fully appreciated initially.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "Keeny curator randomly hosing threshold and forage was oppressive well also just turning into a seven that that part is also quite oppressive"
- "you played it against a blue black deck and you're just like oh this just hates on your whole deck's game plan"
**Key Insights:** Powerful cards with incidental hate effects can disproportionately impact specific opposing strategies.

### Paw Patch Formation - Good "Poor Man's Cash Grab"
**Timestamp:** 0:54:20
**Current Evaluation:** While not as good as Cash Grab (no selection, less graveyard fuel), Paw Patch Formation proved to be a genuinely good card. It provided card advantage plus a Food token, which was valuable, especially in Sealed (hitting flyers/Talents) and food-hungry Green decks.
**Initial Expectations:** Likely viewed as filler or okay.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "Paw Patch formation is the poor man's cash grab it's actually just a good card too"
- "it gives you card plus food"
- "popwatch formation is just a good card in sealed"
- "I felt like the pinch I always had in green decks in sealed was not enough food"
**Key Insights:** Simple card advantage + synergy pieces can overperform, especially when filling a specific need (like Food generation).

### Green's Removal Suite (Hunter's Talent, Longstock Brawl, Poly Wallow) - Excellent
**Timestamp:** 0:55:25
**Current Evaluation:** Green benefited immensely from having three excellent removal options that synergized with its large creatures. Longstock Brawl and Poly Wallow, in particular, overperformed initial expectations, with Poly Wallow being playable in most Green decks, not just Frogs.
**Initial Expectations:** Longstock Brawl and Poly Wallow were likely underestimated.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "green getting three excellent removal spells helped leverage the size of its creatures"
- "long stck brawl... that card was a huge over forer as well I think for me"
- "poly wallup was an over performer... I realized I'm just playing this in most green decks"
**Key Insights:** Access to multiple efficient, synergistic removal spells significantly bolstered Green's dominance.

### Into the Flood Maw - Great Tempo vs. Green
**Timestamp:** 0:56:25
**Current Evaluation:** This cheap Blue bounce spell proved to be a great tempo-positive answer to Green's powerful fight/bite spells (like Longstock Brawl, Poly Wallow). It was better for this specific interaction than Run Away Together due to its lower mana cost.
**Initial Expectations:** Might have underestimated its specific application against Green's removal or preferred other bounce spells initially.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "into the flood maw was a great Tempo positive way to interact with green deex for just a low low cost of a blue Mana"
- "I thought I wanted to do this with runaway together but that was two mana and Tempo negative"
- "into the flood maw as just like a oh I can just hold this up... and get under a fight spell or a bite spell was really nice"
**Key Insights:** Cheap, targeted interaction against dominant strategies is highly valuable, even if narrow.

### Yapper, Eater of All - Enables Disenchant as Removal
**Timestamp:** 0:57:05
**Current Evaluation:** Yapper's ability to turn everything into Food made artifact/enchantment removal effects (like Hivespine Wolverine) function as creature removal, creating powerful synergistic interactions.
**Initial Expectations:** Not contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "yra Eater of all turns your disenchant effects into doomblade because it makes everything food"
- "now we're talking with hypine Wolverine now now we're talking just n n n n n so good"
**Key Insights:** Synergistic rares could combine to create unexpectedly powerful effects.

### Tangle Tumbler - Fun, But Reinforced Strong Deck
**Timestamp:** 0:57:35
**Current Evaluation:** A fun vehicle design that worked well with tokens. However, its best home was Green-White, an already top-tier deck, making it feel like it reinforced the strong rather than enabling weaker archetypes. Acted like a GW-specific Patchwork Banner.
**Initial Expectations:** Not contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "tangle Tumblr was a fun card to make work"
- "I just wish its best home wasn't in one of the best decks"
- "this is a really cool way to make green white a better deck... pushes it over the top"
- "it's like a patchwork Banner for only green white"
**Key Insights:** Interesting card design whose narrow application unfortunately bolstered an already dominant strategy.

### Blacksmith Talent + Star-Forged Sword - Powerful Combo
**Timestamp:** 0:58:20
**Current Evaluation:** Combining these two cards created a potent combo granting +3/+3 and double strike. While the Talent is strong alone, picking up the Sword became worthwhile if you already had the Talent.
**Initial Expectations:** Not contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "blacksmith Talent plus star forged sword was a powerful combo"
- "I loved this plus three plus three double strike"
- "if it once I had a blacksmith Talent... I I'd pick up a star Forge sword for my deck"
**Key Insights:** Identifying specific card synergies, even involving less common picks, could significantly boost a deck's power.

### Scales of Shale - Strong Trick Beyond Lizards
**Timestamp:** 0:58:50
**Current Evaluation:** Best in Red-Black Lizards, but surprisingly strong as a one-of in other Black decks. A late-format realization for Ben (prompted by Ethan). The effect (+2/+0, lifelink, indestructible for 3 mana) is a powerful tempo swing, worth the risk if timed well. Opponents rarely expect it outside RB.
**Initial Expectations:** Likely underestimated outside the dedicated RB archetype. Ben notes it was a late realization.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "scales of shale was best in a lizard's deck but really strong anywhere"
- "this was again a late stage format realization for me thanks to you"
- "plus two plus o LifeLink indestructible for three Mana is a good card and is going reasonable rate"
- "in any other black deck I'm not thinking you have scales of shale"
**Key Insights:** Powerful, archetype-specific tricks can be effective "splash" inclusions elsewhere due to their high impact and surprise factor.

### Heartfire Hero into Manifold Mouse - Oppressive Start
**Timestamp:** 1:00:00
**Current Evaluation:** This Turn 1 into Turn 2 sequence (Hero, then Mouse targeting Hero) created a 2/2 double striker attacking on turn two, one of the most brutal and oppressive openings in the format.
**Initial Expectations:** Not contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "heartfire hero into manifold mouse was one of the most oppressive starts to a game in the format"
- "you're attacking with a two two double strike on turn two... it is brutal"
**Key Insights:** Specific uncommon synergies could lead to incredibly powerful and difficult-to-beat early game sequences.

## Draft & Gameplay Strategy

### Finding the Open Lane - Crucial
**Timestamp:** 0:26:25
**Current Evaluation:** Identifying the open archetype was highly rewarded because many powerful rares and uncommons were narrow ("secret gold cards"). Being in the right seat meant these powerful cards would flow, leading to "juiced" decks. While starting Green was often correct, pivoting to a clearly open lane was essential.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "finding the open Lane was important because many of the premium rares and even uncommons excelled in one deck"
- "if you found yourself in that right lane and those cards were opened they're going to make their way to you and your deck is going to be Juiced"
- "I still think it's probably right to start towards green... but I mean if it's clearly open you're definitely supposed to draft one of the other decks"
**Key Insights:** Reading signals effectively was paramount due to the concentration of narrow, powerful cards within specific archetypes.

### Getting On Board Early - Rewarded
**Timestamp:** 0:27:15
**Current Evaluation:** The format rewarded early plays to establish board presence, enable synergies, pressure the opponent, and sculpt future turns. Playing a two-drop felt important, while keeping hands without early plays was risky.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "bloomo rewarded getting on board early to snowball with Synergy and aggression"
- "also getting on board early was... sculpting your hand a little bit"
- "you had to be spending your man in the early turns like it was closer to you really wanted to be playing a two drop than not"
**Key Insights:** Prioritizing early plays was crucial for tempo, synergy development, and setting up future turns.

### Card Draw & Filtering - Important for Grindy Games
**Timestamp:** 0:30:40
**Current Evaluation:** In the common grindy games, card draw and filtering were essential to combat mana flood/screw. Cheap options (Carrot Cake, Cash Grab, Shoreline Looter, Pond Profit) were highly valuable. Expensive draw spells (Stargaze, Dire Sight, Mind Spiral) were powerful but risky in multiples; best included as one-ofs. Over-prioritizing them could be detrimental.
**Initial Expectations:** Perhaps initially overvalued the expensive draw spells.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "Card draw and filtering were important in games where both players got on board early"
- "you you were fighting Mana flood and Mana screw both right"
- "cards like top performers carrot cake cash grab Shoreline looter etc those cheap ways to sculpt your hand... were really important"
- "a well time stargaze or a dire site or mind spiral... you wanted them but you didn't want too many of them"
- "I think I went overboard on on this aspect of the format"
**Key Insights:** Card selection and advantage were critical for navigating longer games. Cheap filtering was premium, while expensive draw required careful inclusion.

### Secret Gold Cards - Influenced Draft Navigation
**Timestamp:** 0:33:15
**Current Evaluation:** The format contained many cards that were effectively gold, being only truly playable or significantly better in one specific archetype (e.g., Starlet Suir in Bats, Sonar Strike premium in Bats). This reinforced the need to identify and commit to an open lane early.
**Initial Expectations:** Not contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "Bloom BR was full of secret gold cards that usually corresponded with their creature type"
- "Starlet suir was only playable in bats"
- "sonar strike... certainly at its best in bats... but really premium in black white bats right"
**Key Insights:** The prevalence of narrow, archetype-specific cards heavily influenced draft strategy, rewarding early lane identification.

### True Mana Sinks - Valuable for Late Game
**Timestamp:** 0:45:00
**Current Evaluation:** Effective mana sinks were crucial for the format's often grindy nature. Lily-Splash Mentor was a prime example that demanded an answer. Heirloom Epicure also overperformed as a mana sink providing card draw, especially in Sealed and go-wide decks. Talents also served this role well.
**Initial Expectations:** Heirloom Epicure was likely underestimated.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "true Mana SNS were back with a vengeance Lily Splash Mentor excellent"
- "heirloom epichonestly the oneman artifact four tap draw card... amazing and sealed"
- "the talents we great Mana SNS as well"
**Key Insights:** Having ways to utilize excess mana in the late game was very important for winning attrition battles.

### Builder's Talent - Build-Around Potential (with caveats)
**Timestamp:** 0:46:10
**Current Evaluation:** Ethan viewed Builder's Talent as one of the few build-arounds worth pursuing. Ben remained skeptical due to negative experiences trying to force the archetype and failing to get multiple copies. Consensus was that you needed at least two copies for the deck to feel consistent.
**Initial Expectations:** Ben's negative experience stemmed from trying it after a discussion, suggesting initial curiosity but practical difficulties.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "build it and they will come Builder Talent one of the few build rounds in the format worth going after" (Ethan)
- "I feel like I had a bad a bad go of it... so I'm gonna abstain from weighing in" (Ben)
- "you do need two you need two to really feel like you're going to see one atleast consistently"
**Key Insights:** A potentially powerful build-around, but required significant commitment and drafting multiple copies, making it risky and inconsistent.
