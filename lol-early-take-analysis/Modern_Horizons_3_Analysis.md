Okay, here is the analysis comparing the initial takes and retrospective evaluations for the Magic: The Gathering set *Modern Horizons 3* (MH3) Limited format, based on the provided Lords of Limited transcripts.  

## Overview of Analysis  

**Set:** Modern Horizons 3 (MH3)  

**General Patterns:** The initial takes demonstrated a strong early grasp of the format's core pillars (Eldrazi, Energy) and correctly identified several key archetypes and powerful cards (RG Eldrazi, RW Aggro, Writhing Chrysalis). However, the depth and pervasiveness of synergy were somewhat underestimated initially, leading to some misjudgments about the relative strength of certain archetypes (especially the Modified wedge) and the true power level of specific synergistic cards (like Essence Reliquary or Acursed Marauder). The initial takes also slightly overestimated the raw power of some cards (like Cursed Wombat) that didn't find the right synergistic homes as consistently as expected. The importance of finding an open lane and the format's capacity for "cooking" became much clearer with more experience.  

**Most Notable Hits:**  
*   Identifying Red-Green Eldrazi as a top-tier, potentially best, archetype very early.  
*   Recognizing the general strength of Energy strategies (RW, UR).  
*   Pinpointing Writhing Chrysalis as an absurdly powerful common.  
*   Correctly identifying Red and Green as the strongest colors and Blue as the weakest.  
*   Highlighting the power and utility of Fetch Lands.  

**Most Notable Misses:**  
*   Overestimating the strength and cohesion of the Green-White Modified/Counters archetype.  
*   Underestimating the degree to which the Abzan "Modified" theme would fall flat overall.  
*   Overvaluing Cursed Wombat's impact relative to its actual performance in the meta.  
*   Initially underestimating the power and flexibility of certain cards like Acursed Marauder, Molden Gatekeeper, and Essence Reliquary.  
*   The initial take on Cranial Ram being a top-tier signal was walked back slightly.  

## Comparison of Takes  

### Mechanic Assessments  

#### Energy  
**Initial Take:** Energy feels less like a dedicated engine (compared to Kaladesh) and more like an incremental, snowballing resource usable in both aggro and control. Sufficient density of energy producers makes payoffs work.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Energy was a highly successful and powerful mechanic, forming the backbone of several top-tier archetypes (RW Aggro, UW Aggro, UR/Jeskai Control/Midrange). It was one of the two dominant pillars alongside Eldrazi. WotC successfully implemented it for Limited.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** The initial take correctly identified Energy's strength and flexibility across different strategies (aggro/control). It accurately predicted that density, rather than specific engines, was key. It perhaps slightly undersold its overall dominance, as Energy decks formed a major competitive force just behind Eldrazi.  
**Key Factors:** Experience confirmed the initial read on how Energy functioned in MH3, distinct from Kaladesh. The sheer number of strong energy cards across multiple colors solidified its power.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "energy again feels it's it's less of an engine and more of a like an incremental snowbally thing... if you put a bunch of energy cards in your deck you've got enough energy to do the things you want"  
- Retrospective: "energy decks got there in a big way... kudos to watti for... I think they really got it right at least for limited... it's elrazi as tier number one synergies I think to go after an energy not far behind"  
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate  

#### Modified (Abzan)  
**Initial Take:** The "Modified" theme involves specific sub-synergies (+1/+1 counters, adapt) that don't always overlap perfectly. Specific synergy type matters more than just drafting "modified" cards. GW Modified/Counters predicted to be top tier.  
**Retrospective Reality:** The Abzan "Modified" theme significantly underperformed. It lacked cohesion, struggled against Eldrazi and Energy, and its sub-themes didn't synergize well. GW worked better as pure aggro than dedicated counters. BG and WB were weak.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** The initial take correctly identified the lack of perfect overlap between sub-synergies within Modified. However, it significantly overestimated the overall viability and power level of the theme, particularly the GW variant. The prediction of GW being top-tier was a major miss.  
**Key Factors:** The inherent lack of cohesion was correctly noted but its negative impact was underestimated. The power level of Eldrazi and Energy simply outclassed what Modified strategies could typically assemble. The specific payoffs weren't strong enough.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "you have to dig deeper than modified... because there's also a lot of like very specific Sub synergies... green white I think is also awesome... one of the stronger archetypes"  
- Retrospective: "the modified wedge fell flat which was abzan modified just didn't really get there... it was kind of at odds with itself... it just fell in no man's land in the format"  
**Verdict:** Partially Accurate (Correct on internal friction, wrong on overall power)  

#### Eldrazi Ramp  
**Initial Take:** Ramping into large Eldrazi using Spawn tokens appears to be a powerful and effective strategy. RG Eldrazi specifically identified as potentially top tier.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Red-Green Eldrazi was the consensus best archetype. Ramping with Spawn tokens was indeed a dominant strategy, also enabling Temur variants.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** This was spot on. The initial assessment correctly identified the core strength and effectiveness of the Eldrazi ramp plan, particularly in Red-Green.  
**Key Factors:** The efficiency of Spawn generation (especially Writhing Chrysalis) combined with powerful Eldrazi threats was correctly identified as a winning formula early on.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "just ramping eldraziramping just seems really good to me so far... red green alrai is nuts I think one of the better archetypes in the format"  
- Retrospective: "red green eldrazi was the best deck off the back of Chrysalis Titans Vanguard and a host of powerful eldrazi... shout out to us for calling this... I think we really pegged this early"  
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate  

#### Artifacts (Red-Black)  
**Initial Take:** Felt open early, potentially underdrafted. Might require commitment. Needs to be a "premium version" to beat Eldrazi decks. RB Artifacts considered good, possibly very good (Ben), maybe Tier 1.5 (Ethan).  
**Retrospective Reality:** Rakdos Artifacts was a good deck (#7 rank) but riskier to draft due to fewer pivot options. It needed to come together well.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** The initial take was directionally correct. It identified the need for a strong version and the potential risk/reward. The assessment of "good but maybe not top tier" aligns well with the retrospective ranking (#7). The idea it might be underdrafted early seems plausible.  
**Key Factors:** The archetype relied on specific synergistic pieces (Cranial Ram, artifact creatures, sacrifice outlets) which weren't always available, making it less consistent than Eldrazi or Energy. The risk assessment proved accurate.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "the thing I feel about the artifacts deck is you either want a premium version or you don't want to mess with it... Ben: 'red black artifacts is very good'... Ethan: 'even if all the pieces come together you're getting a tier 1.5 deck'"  
- Retrospective: "red black artifacts and blue black draw three were good decks but a little riskier to draft because there wasn't an easy offramp... when it worked it was good but your your drafts might blow up in your face"  
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate  

### Archetype Predictions  

#### Red-Green Eldrazi  
**Initial Take:** Nuts, one of the best, potentially *the* best archetype. Powered by Chrysalis and Vanguard.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Consensus best deck (#1 rank).  
**Accuracy Analysis:** Perfect prediction. Nailed it early.  
**Key Factors:** Correctly identified the power level of key gold cards (Chrysalis, Vanguard) and the synergy between ramp and threats.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "red green alrai is nuts I think one of the better archetypes in the format... [Chrysalis/Vanguard discussion]"  
- Retrospective: "red green eldrazi was the best deck... Ranked #1"  
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate  

#### Green-White Modified/Counters  
**Initial Take:** Awesome, one of the stronger archetypes, capable of explosive starts via Faithful Watchdog and Golden-Tail Trainer.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Underperformed. Ranked #9 (Selesnya Counters Beatdown). Pure aggro worked better than counter synergy focus. Part of the weak "Modified" wedge.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** Significant miss. Overestimated the power and consistency of the counter/modified synergies in GW. While explosive starts were possible, the archetype lacked the resilience and overall power of top decks.  
**Key Factors:** Underestimated how easily the strategy could be disrupted or outclassed by Energy/Eldrazi. The payoffs weren't as strong in practice as they looked on paper. The synergy wasn't as cohesive as needed.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "green white I think is also awesome... one of the stronger archetypes... starts with faithful Watchdog... are some of the most explosive starts"  
- Retrospective: "the modified wedge fell flat... green white as pure aggro worked but like green white as a Synergy counters thing I think didn't... Ranked #9"  
**Verdict:** Mostly Inaccurate  

#### Red-White Aggro  
**Initial Take:** Very strong, better than initially expected, potentially leveraging energy/landfall. Tier 1 potential.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Red-White Energy Aggro was the #2 ranked archetype. A top-tier performer.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly accurate. Correctly identified its strength and potential link to energy.  
**Key Factors:** The combination of aggressive creatures, efficient removal, and energy payoffs proved very effective.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "speaking of aggressive decks the red white aggro deck... I was crazy impressed by... I think red white aggro Beatdown is also very strong"  
- Retrospective: "Ranked #2: Red-White Energy Aggro"  
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate  

#### Blue-Based Archetypes (UB, UG, UW)  
**Initial Take:** Generally ranked lower tier. Weaker gold cards, less impactful commons (outside Tune), lack synergistic overlap. Blue pulls drafters in too many directions.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Blue-based decks were generally ranked lower, outside of Energy variants (UW Energy #6, UR Energy #5, Jeskai Energy #4). Dimir Draw-Three was #8. Pure UG wasn't highly ranked (implicitly part of Temur #3). Blue itself wasn't a top color.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** Mostly accurate. The initial assessment correctly identified Blue's general weakness and lack of strong standalone identity outside of Energy. While Energy variants performed well, the core issues identified (weaker gold cards, less synergy) held true for non-Energy Blue strategies. Dimir Draw-Three was decent but risky.  
**Key Factors:** Blue lacked the raw power of RG Eldrazi or the cohesive synergy engines of the best Energy decks outside of specific builds. Its commons were less impactful overall.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "blue and last mostly because the the blue archetypes just don't quite get there as much... opposite of red blue pulls you in a lot of different directions"  
- Retrospective: "Dimir Draw-Three (#8)... Golgari Counters Grind (#10)... White-Black Grind (#11)... Blue-White Energy (#6)... Blue-Red Energy (#5)... Jeskai Energy Engines (#4)" (Shows Blue needed Energy or specific risky builds to succeed).  
**Verdict:** Mostly Accurate  

#### Black-White  
**Initial Take:** Lower tier, needs specific build (grindy or artifact-focused).  
**Retrospective Reality:** Ranked weakest archetype (#11, White-Black Grind). Could function as control with specific cards like Essence Reliquary, but not a primary strategy.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** Accurate. Correctly identified as a weaker archetype requiring specific pieces to function, and even then, not a top contender.  
**Key Factors:** Lacked a proactive, powerful game plan compared to the rest of the format. Didn't synergize as effectively as other pairs.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "[Bottom Tier includes] white black"  
- Retrospective: "Ranked #11: white black grind... black white I think of as a control Deck with Essence reliquary... I just don't think you want to really be doing the air quotes modified thing"  
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate  

### Color Pair Analyses  

#### Red  
**Initial Take:** Best color due to versatility, strong pairs (RB, RG, RU, RW), flexible commons.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Red was considered one of the best colors, featuring in the #1 (RG), #2 (RW), #5 (UR), and #7 (RB) archetypes.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly accurate. Red's strength and versatility across multiple top archetypes were correctly identified.  
**Key Factors:** Access to strong removal, aggressive creatures, key energy cards, artifact synergies, and Eldrazi ramp enablers.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "I feel pretty strongly that red is number one based on I think its versatility"  
- Retrospective: "red and green were the best colors"  
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate  

#### Green  
**Initial Take:** Second best color, strong in RG, GB, GW. UG weaker. Excels at counters and Eldrazi.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Green was considered one of the best colors, featuring in the #1 (RG) and #3 (Temur) archetypes. BG (#10) and GW (#9) underperformed expectations.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** Partially accurate. Correctly identified Green as a top color and its strength in Eldrazi (RG). However, it overestimated Green's strength in its Modified pairings (GW, BG).  
**Key Factors:** Green's power was heavily tied to the Eldrazi package. Its role in the underperforming Modified strategies dragged down its other pairings.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "I think green number two... very happy with red green... green white I think is also awesome"  
- Retrospective: "red and green were the best colors... Golgari counters grind (#10)... Selesnya Counters Beatdown (#9)"  
**Verdict:** Partially Accurate  

#### Blue  
**Initial Take:** Worst color. Weaker archetypes/gold cards, lacks synergy outside Energy.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Black was ultimately deemed the weakest, but Blue was also not highly rated outside its Energy synergies. Blue decks needed specific builds to succeed.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** Mostly accurate. While Black edged it out for the bottom spot retrospectively, the initial assessment of Blue's weaknesses and reliance on Energy proved correct.  
**Key Factors:** Lack of broadly powerful commons (besides Tune), less cohesive non-Energy synergies.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "blue and last mostly because the the blue archetypes just don't quite get there as much"  
- Retrospective: "red and green were the best colors with black bringing up the rear" (Implies Blue was second-worst). Energy archetypes involving Blue ranked well (#4, #5, #6), but others didn't.  
**Verdict:** Mostly Accurate  

### Card Evaluations  

#### Writhing Chrysalis (RG Common)  
**Initial Take:** Absurdly good, potentially best multicolor common.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Format defining, potentially best common ever seen by the hosts. Divisive due to power level.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly accurate. Nailed the power level immediately.  
**Key Factors:** Efficient body, immediate board presence (two tokens), ramp, reach - an incredibly pushed card.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "that card is absurd yes I think crysalis is awesome... I think I would put that number one"  
- Retrospective: "it's the most busted common we've ever seen probably"  
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate  

#### Faithful Watchdog (GW Common)  
**Initial Take:** Excellent, top multicolor common, enables explosive GW starts.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Ranked #6 among gold commons, below the top tier (Chrysalis, Conduit Goblin, Riddle Gate Gargoyle, Sneaky Snacker, Cranial Ram). GW archetype underperformed.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** Overestimated. While a decent card, it wasn't as format-defining as initially thought, partly because its archetype (GW Counters) wasn't as strong as predicted.  
**Key Factors:** The GW archetype's overall weakness limited the impact of its signpost common compared to signposts in stronger archetypes.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "I think I would put number two faithful Watchdog... enables some of the most explosive starts"  
- Retrospective: Ranked #6 in common signpost power rankings.  
**Verdict:** Mostly Inaccurate  

#### Cranial Ram (RB Common)  
**Initial Take:** Good, crucial for RB artifacts, but maybe not a top-tier signal anymore (Ben). Ethan still impressed.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Ranked #5 among gold commons. Key piece for the viable but risky RB Artifacts deck.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** Accurate. The nuanced take (good, key, but maybe not slam-dunk P1P1) aligns well with the retrospective reality of RB being good but risky, and Ram being a strong but not format-breaking common.  
**Key Factors:** Required specific support (artifacts, evasion) to shine, making it less universally powerful than the absolute top commons.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: Ben: "it's a good card but I'm not seeing cranial RAM and going oh snap"... Ethan: "crazy impressed with cranial Ram plus refurbished familiar"  
- Retrospective: Ranked #5 in common signpost power rankings. RB Artifacts ranked #7 archetype (good but risky).  
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate  

#### Cursed Wombat (BG Uncommon)  
**Initial Take:** Potentially the best multicolor uncommon. Doubles counter *triggers*, making cards like Evolution Witness insane.  
**Retrospective Reality:** BG archetype was weak (#10). Wombat didn't live up to expectations; required too much to go right.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** Significant miss. The theoretical power was high, but the practical application within a weak archetype and a hostile meta (against faster Energy/bigger Eldrazi) meant it rarely achieved its potential.  
**Key Factors:** The BG archetype lacked the support and resilience needed for Wombat to dominate. The setup cost was too high compared to more direct threats.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "cursed swbat is the best one I think... this is so dumb which is just wild"  
- Retrospective: "what happened to it... I felt like everything just had to go so perfectly right" (Referring to BG/Wombat). BG ranked #10.  
**Verdict:** Mostly Inaccurate  

#### Evolution Witness (Green Common)  
**Initial Take:** Initially underrated, now seen as truly excellent, potentially best green common. Kill-on-sight threat.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Retrospective didn't single it out quite as strongly, highlighting Malevolent Rumble (data-backed) and Eldrazi Repurposer as top green commons alongside it. Still a good card, especially with counter manipulation like Nesting Grounds.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** Slightly overestimated. While a very good card, it wasn't definitively the single best green common in the end. Its strength was somewhat tied to the underperforming counter themes.  
**Key Factors:** Malevolent Rumble's versatility and Repurposer's direct synergy with the best archetype (Eldrazi) likely elevated them in the final analysis.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "Evolution witness which I think is the best green common card is great... truly excellent"  
- Retrospective: Top Green Commons: Malevolent Rumble (data), Eldrazi Repurposer also strong. Witness mentioned with Nesting Grounds synergy.  
**Verdict:** Partially Accurate  

#### Smelted Charge Bug (Red Common)  
**Initial Take:** Excellent, flexible common fitting multiple Red archetypes. Forces races, synergistic. Top Red common contender.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Awarded the "Golden Egg" for consistently overperforming. A must-answer threat in artifact/energy decks.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly accurate. Correctly identified its power, flexibility, and synergistic value early on.  
**Key Factors:** Cheap cost, relevant keywords (menace), energy generation, and artifact type made it fit perfectly into several strong strategies.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "charge bug is awesome... it's good in artifact Synergy decks it's good in basic aggressive decks... makes energy"  
- Retrospective: "the golden egg award goes to smelted charge bug... somehow you're just like I can't kill that but like you kind of have to"  
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate  

#### Fetch Lands (Common Land Cycle)  
**Initial Take:** Incredible, huge part of the format, versatile (fixing, colorless, landfall, sacrifice, shuffle), very high picks.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Excellent utility (fixing, splash, colorless, sacrifice, landfall). Not typically high *early* picks (direction first), but phenomenal role-players picked mid-pack.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly accurate on power and utility. Slightly adjusted view on pick order (valuable, but not necessarily P1P1 over key archetype pieces).  
**Key Factors:** Their flexibility was immense, but establishing archetype direction often took priority in the first few picks.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "the fetch lands are incredible and I think a huge part of the format... these fetch lands like they just do so so so so much... very high picks"  
- Retrospective: "the fetchlands do a lot in the format but they aren't super high pit picks early on in the draft... these lands were absolutely phenomenal"  
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate  

### General Strategy & Format Feel  

#### Highly Synergistic Format
**Initial Take:** Extremely synergistic, more than anticipated. Combining cards effectively is key. Reminiscent of Ikoria.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Fundamentally synergy-driven. Evaluating cards in isolation is ineffective. Success hinges on cohesive decks. Ability to "cook" with cross-archetype synergies.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly accurate. The initial feeling about the depth of synergy was spot on and became the defining characteristic of the format.  
**Key Factors:** The density of build-arounds, cross-synergies, and mechanics like Energy and Eldrazi Spawn rewards cohesive deckbuilding.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "this format's highly synergistic way more so even than I would have thought"  
- Retrospective: "modern Horizon 3 is a Synergy driven format evaluating cards in a vacuum really didn't work here"  
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate  

#### Synergy Trumps Raw Power  
**Initial Take:** Powerful synergies are more prevalent and impactful than individually powerful cards. Decks win through combinations.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Synergy was more important than removal. Popping off with synergy was the goal. Finding card *ceilings* within synergy was key, not average performance.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly accurate. This core principle held true throughout the format's lifespan.  
**Key Factors:** The best decks achieved "broken" plays through synergy, overwhelming opponents who relied on generically good cards or excessive interaction without a proactive plan.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "powerful Synergy we trumps individual power... you're not losing to one card you're losing to a combination of three cards"  
- Retrospective: "removal was important but Synergy was more important... popping off with Synergy was more important than having the removal... mh3 draft is about finding the ceilings of the cards you draft"  
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate  

#### Draft Strategy: Focus on Synergy Spaces / Finding Open Lane  
**Initial Take:** Staying "open" means finding cards in the same *synergy space* (Energy, Modified, Artifacts, Eldrazi), not just color. Prioritize drafting cards that work together.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Finding an open archetype/lane was crucial to get powerful synergistic pieces late. Pivoting effectively was key. Drafting a synergistic *open* deck mattered more than forcing the "best" colors.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly accurate. The initial concept of drafting synergy spaces evolved into the practical importance of reading signals to find an uncontested lane for those synergies.  
**Key Factors:** The high power level of synergistic payoffs meant getting the key commons/uncommons late was a huge advantage, only possible if the archetype was open.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "I feel more on track and more open with a start of three cards of three different colors that want to play in the same Synergy space... starting big [synergy space] and then honing your way in... is I think the the best way"  
- Retrospective: "it was imperative that you found an open Lane during the draft to get powerful synergies late for an uncontested archetype... drafting a synergistic open deck mattered way more than being in the best colors"  
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate  

## Patterns and Insights  

*   **Core Pillars Identified:** The initial takes correctly identified the main competing forces: Eldrazi ramp and Energy value. This formed a solid foundation for understanding the format.  
*   **Synergy Depth Underestimated:** While synergy was noted as important initially, its sheer depth, the viability of cross-archetype "cooking," and the necessity of maximizing card *ceilings* within synergy (rather than floors) became much clearer later.  
*   **Overestimation of "Fair" Synergy:** The Modified theme, particularly GW Counters, seemed powerful on paper but represented a more "fair" synergy strategy that couldn't compete with the "broken" potential of top Energy and Eldrazi decks. The initial takes somewhat overvalued this fairer approach.  
*   **Gold Card Power Levels:** Initial takes were very good at identifying the power level of the best gold commons/uncommons (Chrysalis, Vanguard, Watchdog, Ram), though Watchdog was slightly overrated and Wombat significantly so. The retrospective confirmed these cheap gold cards were huge signals.  
*   **Flexibility Valued:** Cards offering flexibility (Fetch Lands, MDFCs, commons fitting multiple archetypes like Smelted Charge Bug) were correctly identified early and remained highly valued.  
*   **Context is King:** The retrospective heavily emphasized that card evaluation depended entirely on context and synergy, making vacuum assessments or pure data reliance (like GiH WR) less reliable than usual. This was understood initially but perhaps not to the full extent revealed by experience.  
*   **Blind Spot: Weak Archetypes:** The initial takes correctly identified Blue as weak but were too optimistic about GW and potentially BG, underestimating how much the Modified theme would struggle overall.  

## Conclusion  

Overall, the initial Lords of Limited takes on MH3 provided a remarkably accurate early framework for navigating the format. They successfully identified the dominant strategies (Eldrazi, Energy), key colors (Red/Green strong, Blue weak), and several format-defining cards like Writhing Chrysalis and the Fetch Lands. The core understanding that MH3 was a highly synergistic format where combinations mattered more than individual card power was present from the start.  

The main areas where initial evaluations needed refinement were in underestimating the *degree* to which synergy dominated (leading to overvaluing the less cohesive Modified theme, especially GW) and missing the full potential ceiling of some less obvious synergistic cards (Acursed Marauder, Essence Reliquary). The retrospective also highlighted the crucial skill of finding an open lane, which became more apparent as the format matured. Despite some misses, particularly around the Modified wedge, the initial predictions offered strong guidance and captured the essential dynamics of a complex and rewarding Limited environment. The analysis demonstrates a good initial read, refined by experience into a deeper understanding of the format's nuances and synergistic potential.
