Okay, here are the extracted predictions, hot takes, and initial evaluations from the Lords of Limited transcript regarding the Magic: The Gathering set *Outlaws of Thunder Junction*.

## Overview

This episode covers the hosts' (Ben and Ethan) initial impressions of the *Outlaws of Thunder Junction* Limited format after participating in pre-release events and observing/playing the Early Access event on MTG Arena. They discuss mechanics, format speed, color strength, specific cards, and early archetype considerations based on their limited experience.

## Mechanic Assessments

### Committing Crimes - Strong and Exciting Mechanic
**Timestamp:** [00:05:40]
**Take:** Committing Crimes is a powerful and central mechanic with good payoffs and plentiful enablers, making it a key element to focus on for increasing win percentage.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "committing crimes that is currently the thing I am most excited about the payoffs I think seem great and the ways to trigger them seem plentiful if you're prioritizing them"
- "I think it's the most interesting piece of the format's puzzle with like the greatest yield for upping your win percentage"
- "committing crimes has been easy when you want to do it like it just happens naturally and then if you're trying to do it you can do it almost every turn"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Crime Lands - Very Good, Especially Tutored
**Timestamp:** [00:06:25]
**Take:** The common dual lands that commit crimes ("Crime Lands") are very impressive, especially due to their synergy with the mechanic and the ability to be tutored by green land-finding effects, aiding splashes. Sequencing them is an interesting puzzle.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I think the the crime lands have just crazy impressed"
- "the crime lands just them them having them being tutorable by basically all of the green things that find lands that's a big game"
- "sequencing crime lands much like people who have 9,000 unread emails... there are people... who responsibly play that crime land tapped on turn one and then there are people who are trying to squeeze that value for the potential crime trigger"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Plot - Powerful, but Cost-Sensitive
**Timestamp:** [00:08:05]
**Take:** Plot is a powerful mechanic overall, enabling tempo swings and strategic plays. However, there's a significant difference in power level based on cost; plotting for 2 or 3 mana is strong, while plotting for 4 or 5 mana is often too slow and tempo-negative.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I still think this is a powerful mechanic"
- "there is a huge difference between things that can plot for two or three Mana versus four or five Mana"
- "you just can't you really can't afford I think to invest four Mana to not impact the board"
- "the power turns that you can set up via planning and hiding your creatures with plot and then putting multiple out at once the tempo swings you can create seem amazing to me"
**Confidence Level:** High (on the mechanic's potential), Medium (on the cost sensitivity evaluation)

### Mounts/Saddle - Cost-Sensitive and Vulnerable
**Timestamp:** [00:17:35]
**Take:** Mounts are playable, but like Plot, cheaper mounts (2-3 mana) are significantly better than expensive ones (4+ mana), especially those with high Saddle costs (Saddle 3+). Good creatures that happen to have Saddle are desirable, but mounts in general are vulnerable to the format's efficient removal.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "the two and three Mana mounts are obviously way better than like the four plus mounts"
- "especially because like some of those have like saddle for three or whatever which is that's a lot like crew three is huge"
- "the creatures that are good that happen to have a saddle bonus like those are just the ones to keep an eye out on"
- "I still am worried about like mounts are just mostly cards without great etbs and they just they just get owned so hard by the good removal in the format"
**Confidence Level:** Medium

## Format Speed & Gameplay Impressions

### Format Speed - Slower Than Recent Sets
**Timestamp:** [00:11:55]
**Take:** The format feels slower ("normal speed," "a sco slower") than recent formats like MKM or LCI. While still modern Limited, there seems to be more room for catch-up mechanics and less punishment for falling slightly behind on board (though stumbling on mana remains very punishing).
**Supporting Statements:**
- "the format feels more normal speed to me like a sco slower than we've seen lately"
- "not that you get quite so horrifically punished and there's much more catch-up type mechanics"
- "I think stumbling on lands punishes you really hard not necessarily stumbling on board presence"
**Confidence Level:** Medium

### Aggro Strategy - Pure Aggro Less Effective
**Timestamp:** [00:12:35]
**Take:** Pure curve-out aggressive strategies ("cabs") seem less effective as Plan A compared to recent formats. Decks need more synergy or ways to gain reach/value if the game stalls.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "curving out and smashing has been very powerful and I I don't think it is here I don't think that is plan a for the best decks in this form it"
- "anything that's just plain creatures trying to curve out without other synergies going on like just beat down Agro cabs ain't it cabs ain't it in this format I don't think no"
- "I think your aggro deck also needs some ways to if the game stalls out a bit to to find ways to get reach"
**Confidence Level:** Medium

### ETB Value & Recursion - Key Theme
**Timestamp:** [00:13:10]
**Take:** Creatures with good Enter-the-Battlefield (ETB) effects are highly valuable, and the format provides numerous ways (blink, bounce, reanimation) to abuse these triggers repeatedly, suggesting grindy value strategies will be strong.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I've been crazy impressed with good etbs there's been a lot of creatures with good etbs"
- "along with that there's tons of blinks and bounces and reanimates and just ways to like repeatedly abuse those ETB triggers"
- "Format to me so far from what I've seen has seemed like get some great cards and then get a bunch of cards that complement those great cards really well and try to do them over and over and over and over"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Removal Quality - Bonus Value Matters
**Timestamp:** [00:19:20]
**Take:** Removal is great, but only if it's efficient *and/or* provides additional value (commits a crime, gains life, has Spree flexibility, exiles). Simple one-for-one removal without bonuses is significantly less desirable than usual.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I do think removal is great but I think Great Removal is great or good removal is good... removal that does nothing else for you I don't think makes the cut here"
- "because there are so many removal spells that give you a bonus... or are hyper efficient"
- "just killing something even if it's at a pretty good rate like by limited heris explosive derailment should be amazing and I I think it's not even close to the top red common"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Bomb Rares/Mythics - Potential Concern
**Timestamp:** [00:13:35]
**Take:** Ethan expresses concern that the density of powerful rares/mythics (including Big Score and OTP slots) might make the format feel too much like "bomb rare roulette," similar to BRO's artifact sheet. Ben is more optimistic about the strength of commons/uncommons.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I'm worried that this is going to be again with the the sort of the big score and the um OTP reprint slot that like there is we're just in a repeat of the artifact remix of like just take the card in the upper left corner"
- "I do think there are a lot of great rares but I also think there's a lot of pushed Commons and uncommons"
**Confidence Level:** Medium (Ethan's concern), Medium (Ben's optimism)

## Color Pair Analysis & Power Rankings

### Color Power Ranking (Initial)
**Timestamp:** [00:14:45]
**Take:** Initial ranking places Black clearly at the top and White clearly at the bottom. Blue and Red are contenders for #2/#3, with Green likely #4. Disagreement exists on Blue vs Red for the #2 spot.
**Supporting Statements:**
- Ben: Black > Blue > Red > Green > White
- Ethan: "I would put black and then like two greater than signs before the next color"
- Ethan: "feel great about white being number five I've not been thrilled about white... kind of shallow... weakest"
- Ethan: "I would put red second personally over blue"
**Confidence Level:** Medium (overall ranking is tentative), High (on Black #1, White #5)

### Top Archetypes (Initial)
**Timestamp:** [00:16:45]
**Take:** The most impressive archetypes so far seem to involve Blue or Black: Blue-White (Control), Blue-Black (Control/Crimes), Red-Black (Outlaws/Plot/Crimes), Green-Black (Recursion/Grind), and Blue-Red (Spells/Tempo).
**Supporting Statements:**
- "you have five best decks here that all either blue or black which checks out with your your top two colors there as well"
- "blue white blue black red black green black and blue red are the ones I've been pretty impressed by"
**Confidence Level:** Low to Medium (very early assessment)

### White Archetypes - Concerningly Weak
**Timestamp:** [00:36:45]
**Take:** Both hosts express concern about the overall strength and identity of White archetypes (BW, RW, GW). White seems to lack standout commons and its synergies feel less powerful compared to other colors. Its best home might be as a support color in UW Control.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I'm worried about the white archetypes that's what I'm I'm feeling that too right now"
- "I like black white but I'm like but that's just cuz black is... great"
- "green white mounts I'm very worried about"
- Ben struggles to name key white cards he actively likes for the UW deck.
**Confidence Level:** Medium

## Card Evaluations

### Lone Shark (3U 3/4 Plot 3U) - Overrated/Disappointing
**Timestamp:** [00:08:30]
**Take:** Ethan considers Lone Shark a "biggest mover down." Plotting for 4 mana feels too slow, and the payoff isn't unique enough compared to just double-spelling with any other 4-drop after plotting something cheaper on turn 3.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "maybe the biggest the biggest mover down for me is Lone shark"
- "you just can't you really can't afford I think to invest four Mana to not impact the board"
- "plotting on three and then double spelling with any four drop on four is probably going to be good and it doesn't have to be lone sharkk drawing a card too"
**Confidence Level:** Medium to High (Ethan is strong, Ben is receptive)

### Phantom Interference (U Spree Counter/Token) - Underwhelming
**Timestamp:** [00:25:20]
**Take:** Both hosts found Phantom Interference underwhelming. It's often played around easily (cheap spells, plotting) and feels bad in proactive decks. Likely only decent in dedicated draw-go control, making it a low pick.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I was very underwhelmed by this in Early Access it was played around multiple times"
- "if you're trying to be proactive... it's just pretty horrendous"
- "I've watched it be pretty medium a lot"
- "Phantom interference is probably only good in the draw go control decks and if that's the case you're not going to need to pick it that highly"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Desperate Bloodseeker (1B 2/2 Lifelink, Mill 2) - Excellent Common
**Timestamp:** [00:26:10]
**Take:** This card is considered excellent, a bread-and-butter two-drop for black decks. It's good in graveyard strategies but also valuable just for the stats, lifelink, committing a crime on ETB, and recursion potential.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I think this card is excellent I think it's just like a bread and butter two drop"
- "it commits crimes... two Mana 2 two LifeLink I think is just good right"
- "I think desperate blood Seeker is one of Black's best Commons probably Black's best common creature"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Lively Durge (1B Spree Tutor-to-Grave/Reanimate) - Better Than Expected
**Timestamp:** [00:27:00]
**Take:** Initially underestimated, the mode allowing you to tutor a 3-4 mana bomb from your library directly into play makes this card significantly more powerful and flexible than just a simple reanimation spell. Still likely not a super high pick, but very potent in the right deck.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I realized that there was a mode of this card that I just completely didn't think of which was if you have... bombs that are three Mana or four Mana... this just becomes five Mana search that up get it back... and that is extremely powerful"
- "this card is good not super high pick though like just playable in the right deck"
**Confidence Level:** High (on improved evaluation), Medium (on pick order)

### Rakish Crew (2B Enchantment) - Narrow (RB Gold Card)
**Timestamp:** [00:27:55]
**Take:** This card is much narrower than initially thought. The tempo loss of spending 3 mana for a 1/1 is severe, requiring significant Outlaw synergy to pay off. It's likely only good in dedicated Black-Red Outlaw decks, effectively acting like a gold card.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "it it's so narrow"
- "this is incredible in black red I think okayish in black white but like white doesn't have a lot of Outlaws"
- "playing three Mana for a one one is atrocious"
- "I would say black red gold card yeah that's right"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Raven of Fell Omens (1B 1/1 Flyer, Crime Drain) - Potential Build-Around
**Timestamp:** [00:28:50]
**Take:** This common has potential as a "collect them all" build-around. With multiple copies and ways to commit crimes consistently (especially at instant speed via crime lands/spells), it can enable a potent tempo/drain strategy, possibly defining its own archetype.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I thought so I liked it... I had very good experience with this"
- "it felt very catch them all build around at common and if you can do that I think it's going to be good"
- "you really want to think about... what are my ways to do it at instant speed... commit a crime on my turn commit a crime on my opponent's turn"
- "I think that's a deck I think that's a real deck in the format"
**Confidence Level:** Medium (potential seems high, but needs specific support)

### Shoot the Sheriff (1B Instant Destroy Non-Outlaw) - Bad/Sideboard
**Timestamp:** [00:29:45]
**Take:** This removal spell is considered quite bad ("rough") due to the high density of powerful Outlaw creatures in the format, especially in Grixis colors. It will often be dead or lack good targets. Primarily a sideboard card against non-Outlaw heavy decks (like Green-White).
**Supporting Statements:**
- "shoot the sheriff is rough"
- "there are so many good Outlaws and then if you're playing against grixis you're just like can I please find a Target"
- "this does nothing for you like there's just way better removal than this I I think I'm totally offshoot the sheriff"
- "sideboarded in against white green yeah like might play it but I I do not think it is premium"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Vault Plunderer (2B 3/1 ETB Draw/Lose 1) - Incredible
**Timestamp:** [00:30:15]
**Take:** Considered an incredible common, providing immediate card advantage attached to a relevant body. Compares favorably to cards like Inspiring Overseer in impact. Synergizes well with black's recursion.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "Vault plunderer is incredible"
- "got some inspiring overseer Vibes for sure"
- "you just grown when your opponent plays it because you know like you know you've gotten two for one already because that's a real body"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Rutstein, Troubled Mogul (1BG 3/2 ETB Gravedigger + Cost Reduction) - Extremely Strong
**Timestamp:** [00:31:15]
**Take:** Evaluated as possibly the "best Gravedigger ever" due to the added cost reduction for creature spells, enabling explosive turns and synergizing perfectly with graveyard/recursion strategies.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "best Grave Digger ever truly"
- "speaking of like best friends with Vault plunderer like turn five rutstein get back plunderer plunderer now costs two"
- "it's just explosive and then rutstein pairs so well with... all this recursion in black"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Silver Deputy (1W 1/2 Mercenary Tutor) - Overperformer
**Timestamp:** [00:32:05]
**Take:** This card overperformed expectations, particularly in Sealed. Its ability to tutor any basic or *Desert* (including crime lands or splash lands) to the top is valuable fixing/utility, and the Mercenary token ability is relevant.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "certainly an over performer in sealed I think because it gives you colorless fixing but also again being able to fetch up deserts I think is big game"
- "I've been very impressed by the mercenary tokens so the fact that this has that text is I think good"
**Confidence Level:** Medium to High

### Aird Archway (Desert Karoo Land) - Insane/Unpassable?
**Timestamp:** [00:33:10]
**Take:** This land is considered exceptionally powerful ("insane," "nuts"). It provides mana acceleration, card advantage (land bounce), card selection (surveil if bouncing a desert), and enables crime replays. Potentially an unpassable pick.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "erid Archway is nuts"
- "my friend Jared uh JM he typed in chat ER Archway might be unpassable it's so good"
- "picking up deserts to let you replay crimes while also letting you surveil and being a two for one intrinsically"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Take Up the Shield (1W Combat Trick) - Likely Bad/Overrated
**Timestamp:** [00:35:45]
**Take:** Ben is "horrifically underwhelmed" and puts this card "on significant notice." It feels like "small ball" compared to format synergies, is vulnerable to interaction (bounce/exile), and the format may not be aggressive enough for it to shine.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "this card is on notice from me... significant notice from me like getting ready to be benched"
- "creatures plus take up the shield is so small ball compared to the synergies that exist in the format"
- "I just don't think the format's aggressive enough to where take up the shield is as good as it normally is"
- "I was horrifically underwhelmed by this card"
**Confidence Level:** High (Ben's negative evaluation)

### Hardbristle Bandit (1G Mana Dork) - Terrible
**Timestamp:** [00:38:05]
**Take:** Ethan completely reverses his initial positive evaluation, now calling the card terrible and effectively a mulligan.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "huge point for Ethan this is one in a green for a one- one... this card is a mulligan this card's terrible it's really bad"
- "I'm sorry listeners don't pick hard Crystal Bandit"
**Confidence Level:** High (Ethan's negative evaluation)

### Emergent Haunting (1U Enchantment/Flyer) - Very Strong Early
**Timestamp:** [00:39:45]
**Take:** This card is potentially a "beating" if played on turn two, especially if followed up by plotting or holding up interaction on turn three to ensure it flips into a 3/3 flyer.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I think this card is a beating on turn two"
- "if you can do this pass and still spend your mana on turn three while flipping this two Mana 33 flyer is real good"
**Confidence Level:** Medium to High

### Rise of the Varmints (3G Sorcery Make Tokens, Plot 2G) - Strong Late Game
**Timestamp:** [00:40:30]
**Take:** A strong, splashable card for longer games. Plotting it early allows for a significant board presence later. Doesn't require an excessive number of creatures in the graveyard to be effective (3-4 tokens is good). Best in BG but potentially playable elsewhere with enough creatures.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "rise of the varmints I'm here for it yeah I I mean... it's good it's splashable and the games go long"
- "making sure you have a way to go over the top and Rise of the varmints is a great way to go over the top"
- "like you make three two ones you're pretty darn happy right like it doesn't have to make eight for you to feel great about the card"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Make Your Own Luck (3GU Sorcery Draw/Plot) - Excellent ("Mold Drifter Level")
**Timestamp:** [00:41:30]
**Take:** Considered excellent, comparable in power level to Mulldrifter. Provides significant card advantage (draw 2, plot 1) for five mana. Great even if the plotted card isn't a bomb.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "you said this is mold Drifter levels of good yeah it is okay this card is just mold Drifter"
- "it's like play a thing a turn later draw two cards this card is excellent"
- "I think this card is just great with no work at all"
**Confidence Level:** High

### Intimidation Campaign (UB Enchantment) - Disputed
**Timestamp:** [00:43:45]
**Take:** There is significant disagreement on this card. Ben believes it's strong in the predicted longer games, while Ethan finds it "a little clunky" and potentially too slow despite the value it generates.
**Supporting Statements:**
- Ethan: "I don't think it's that good is that blasphemy am I wrong"
- Ben: "You're wrong I've played with it games go long he said and you don't want intimidation campaign get out of here"
- Ethan: "it's a little clunky it's a little clunky"
- Ben: "this is horrible this is horrible terrible way to end the podcast"
**Confidence Level:** Low (due to strong disagreement)

## Drafting Strategy

### Taking Gold Cards Early - Caution Advised?
**Timestamp:** [00:20:30]
**Take:** Ethan suggests potentially avoiding taking gold cards very early, instead focusing on getting deep into a single color first. This might be more effective in the Play Booster era with double signposts per color pair, allowing you to capitalize on an open lane later. Ben remains undecided, noting the power and splashability of some gold cards.
**Supporting Statements:**
- Ethan: "stop taking gold cards early... I don't need to take private eye early... just get deep into a color and then try and pair it and I'm wondering if that's maybe a play booster world"
- Ethan: "finding that open Lane getting deep into a color and then figuring out what to pair it with is so much more valuable"
- Ben: "jury's still out for me here... I think it depends format to format how aggressively you want to take gold cards"
**Confidence Level:** Low (speculative strategy adjustment)

### Fixing and Splashing - Desert Lands are Key
**Timestamp:** [00:18:30]
**Take:** Fixing quality can vary significantly based on Desert land openings in Sealed. In Draft, Desert lands (especially crime lands) are important and might influence color/splash decisions. Be cautious about playing Green solely for fixing if it doesn't offer other synergies. Longer predicted game lengths might make splashing more viable.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "fixing felt scarce maybe isn't the right word but just like varied like the the depends on the deserts that you open"
- "I would pay attention in this format to deserts dictating a bit"
- "be wary of like playing Green for fixing in that respect... if you can afford to not play Green"
- "if my vision about the the best deck in the format being late game formats correct then I I could see taking gold gold cards a little more aggressively [implying splashing is viable]"
**Confidence Level:** Medium
