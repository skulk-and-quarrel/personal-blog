## Format Characteristics

### Point #1: OTJ was a Prince Format
**Timestamp:** Point #1
**Current Evaluation:** The format heavily favored decks with powerful rares and uncommons. Drafts often felt underpowered without opening or being passed strong rares early.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly compared, but the emphasis suggests it was more pronounced than usual.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I think if any if if we're going to use it [Prince format] this is a format that it is apt to use it for."
- "I think this format qualifies you were really disappointed I think if you didn't open a good rare..."
- "if you didn't get past pack one pick three a busted rare you were a little you're a little bummed you're feeling like your draft was a little underpowered maybe."
- "I do think this was one of the most powerful formats we've had the rares were great the uncommons were very powerful..."
**Key Insights:** Success in OTJ drafts was strongly correlated with accessing high-rarity bombs. While common/uncommon strategies existed (like Green-White), the overall power level was driven by rares.

### Point #2: Three-for-Ones are the New Two-for-Ones
**Timestamp:** Point #2
**Current Evaluation:** Cards providing significant card advantage (like Plan the Heist, Make Your Own Luck) were extremely common and impactful, devaluing simple two-for-ones. Standard value cards felt less impactful.
**Initial Expectations:** The prevalence and impact of 3-for-1s seemed higher than initially anticipated, explaining why decks full of traditional value cards sometimes struggled.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "shout out to I think the poster Childs for these are plan the heist and make your own luck..."
- "my whole journey of trying to figure out why my deck's full of Vault plunderers and prickly pears and harass Wolverines just didn't get there..."
- "two for ones were just everywhere in this format like you could get two for one four five six times and still be in the game."
**Key Insights:** The baseline for card advantage was higher in OTJ. Simple 2-for-1s weren't enough to pull significantly ahead; decks needed ways to generate overwhelming advantage or close the game quickly.

### Point #4: Removal is Great and Plentiful
**Timestamp:** Point #4
**Current Evaluation:** Removal spells, especially at common, were effective and necessary to deal with the format's powerful threats. This marks a potential shift back towards removal being important, possibly due to Play Boosters and high power level.
**Initial Expectations:** Contrasted with previous formats where efficient threats often outclassed removal at common.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "removal is great and plentiful in this format it's two sets in a row now are play boosters Reviving removal?"
- "certainly if there's going to be this many rares and they're going to be this good you're going to need to kill them."
- "it feels like the pendulum has swung back... as we go through the the commons the top Commons in each color according to our experience it's a lot of removal."
**Key Insights:** The high density of powerful rares and uncommons necessitated having ample interaction. Common removal spells were crucial components of successful decks.

### Point #5: OTJ Felt Slow (Despite Data)
**Timestamp:** Point #5
**Current Evaluation:** Despite potential data suggesting otherwise, the format *felt* slower than recent aggressive formats. One-drops were generally not good, and games often involved slower development.
**Initial Expectations:** Contrasted with the feeling of recent formats like LCI ("year of the one drop").
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I don't care what the data says otj was one of the slowest formats we've had in a while..."
- "this felt different meaningfully different than the formats we've had recently where One Drops Were King One Drops were not good."
- "you don't feel so deadly behind when your opponent plays a two drop on two."
- "there's a lot of games where you have whatever gx's crimes against that and you're going land go land go land go shock your thing..."
**Key Insights:** The *texture* of the gameplay felt slower, with less emphasis on early aggression and more room for setup and development compared to immediately preceding sets.

### Point #8: Too Many Bonus Sheets
**Timestamp:** Point #8
**Current Evaluation:** The combination of The Big Score (SPG), Breaking News (OTP), and Special Guests (SPG) felt like overload, adding complexity and variance.
**Initial Expectations:** The sheer number and overlap of bonus sheets were confusing and perhaps detrimental.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "otj had one too many bonus sheets for our liking..."
- "I think it just in tandem with all the other stuff got to be a bit too much."
- "I think for me like I'm a very invested magic player... when the thing came out with like the six different set symbols I I was just like okay I'm tapping out like I'll figure this out later like too much."
**Key Insights:** While individual bonus sheets might be fine, the cumulative effect in OTJ created cognitive load and potentially excessive variance.

### Point #18: OTJ Turned Heuristics On Their Head
**Timestamp:** Point #18
**Current Evaluation:** Several common Limited heuristics didn't apply or were reversed in OTJ. Green's large stats were dominant, and typical "small ball" synergy decks (like Grixis) struggled against the raw power and size.
**Initial Expectations:** Standard evaluations (like prioritizing synergy over raw stats, or assuming Grixis colors offer strong synergy payoffs) needed adjustment.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "Green stats being some of the best things to do in the format..."
- "Lords of limited underrating green more news at 11..."
- "the grix Synergystuff was just too small ball to compete with the green stats..."
- "you really weren't doing it for like Raven ofel Omens... blood Hustler similarly like you just can't afford to play a two Mana 1 one..."
**Key Insights:** Format context is crucial. OTJ rewarded raw power and size (Green) more than intricate, low-to-the-ground synergies that might excel in other environments.

### Point #23: Rewarded Staying Open
**Timestamp:** Point #23
**Current Evaluation:** Due to the high power level distributed across colors and archetypes, staying open during the draft and finding the available lane was highly rewarded. Strong decks could be built even if the initial picks didn't yield bombs.
**Initial Expectations:** Standard drafting advice, but particularly relevant in a format with such depth of power.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "otj drafts rewarded you for staying open and finding the right lane because there was plenty of power in the draft."
- "in the era of play boosters where the wheel doesn't exist when the wheel does exist you can get a really really strong deck."
- "you also want to be hyper aware of when that open color pair when the other seven play at the tables have said I actually don't want to draft black white cool more ruthless lawbringers for me right."
**Key Insights:** Don't commit too early without strong signals. The power level was high enough that finding the open colors often led to a powerful deck.

### Point #36: Recursion Was Prevalent and Oppressive
**Timestamp:** Point #36
**Current Evaluation:** Numerous effective ways to recur threats existed (Shepherd of the Clouds, Honest Rutstein, Badlands Revival, Back for More, Lively Durge, Mner's Surprise), leading to frustrating loops, especially with powerful rares.
**Initial Expectations:** The density and power of recursion combined with powerful rares created a negative play experience for one host (Ben).
**Supporting Statements:**
- "there were a lot of ways to recur threats from your graveyard and they all worked well together."
- "the best I think most oppressive Loop was Shepherd of the clouds get back honest rutstein..."
- "my thoughts on honest ret honestly might have been one of the worst parts of the format for me I I really did not enjoy the rares being as powerful as they were plus the recursion being as plentiful and as good as it was..."
**Key Insights:** The combination of high-impact threats and readily available, strong recursion defined many late-game scenarios and could feel overwhelming.

### Point #43: Tons of Fixing Available
**Timestamp:** Point #43
**Current Evaluation:** Fixing was abundant through various commons and uncommons (Oasis Gardener, Gold Pan Bandit, Silver Deputy, Crime Lands, green fixing), making splashing easy and contributing to many decks feeling "soupy" (3-5 colors).
**Initial Expectations:** The ease of splashing might contradict the stated goal of Play Boosters making rares less splashable.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "otj had tons of fixing available for you to play all the powerful cards you saw..."
- "if you wanted to Splish Splash around otj had you covered."
- "a lot of the decks ended up feeling supy to me either by my from myself or on the other side of the battlefield just like three to five color good stuff and that's partially because if you wanted to Splash you could it was not hard."
**Key Insights:** The abundance of fixing encouraged multicolor decks, often prioritizing raw power over streamlined two-color synergy.

### Point #49: Uncommons are the New Commons
**Timestamp:** Point #49
**Current Evaluation:** Uncommons felt more like the core role-players and sources of synergy/power than commons did, possibly a trend in the Play Booster era. Only the very best commons felt essential.
**Initial Expectations:** A potential shift from the traditional focus on commons as the backbone of Limited decks.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "it feels like you kind of just want the only the best common in your deck like they're not where you're getting role players often times..."
- "you're getting perhaps because it's a deeper roster now you're getting role players at uncommon..."
- "I do think it's it's again it's one of the things I I'm very aware of as a content creator of like how we're going to start what that shift is..."
**Key Insights:** Deck building might increasingly rely on drafting synergistic uncommons, with commons primarily filling gaps or providing top-tier interaction/threats.

### Point #50: Overall Format Assessment
**Timestamp:** Point #50
**Current Evaluation:** A good, deep draft format with complex gameplay, rewarding tight play and strategic depth. However, it felt somewhat homogeneous (lots of Green/multicolor good stuff) and wasn't an "all-timer" for the hosts.
**Initial Expectations:** N/A (Final Verdict)
**Supporting Statements:**
- "otj was a good draft format but it is not an altimer for us."
- "I learned alot I think it has some very clear Rules of Engagement had some cool late format you know meta shift..."
- "ultimately felt a little homogeneous for me..." (Ben)
- "I think one of the things that stands out to me the most about it is the gameplay was really good... really rewarded tight and good gameplay and was really deep strategically." (Ethan)
**Key Insights:** OTJ offered strategic depth and rewarding gameplay but might have lacked archetype diversity or pleasant play patterns for some, preventing it from reaching top-tier status for the hosts.

## Mechanic Evaluations

### Point #9: W.A.R.P. Outlaw Synergy
**Timestamp:** Point #9
**Current Evaluation:** The Outlaw creature type synergy (Warlock, Assassin, Rogue, Pirate, Mercenary) was underpowered and largely irrelevant.
**Initial Expectations:** The named mechanic didn't live up to potential expectations.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "wh one out for war PE Outlaw Synergy was underpowered in otj..."
- "we really didn't get to to use the full cup of warm pee that this format had to potentially offer..."
**Key Insights:** The specific Outlaw tribal synergies were not strong enough to be a major build-around focus.

### Point #10: Committing Crimes
**Timestamp:** Point #10
**Current Evaluation:** A very flavorful and powerful mechanic, especially for building controlling archetypes (often Blue-based). Added significant depth to card evaluation and sequencing.
**Initial Expectations:** Positive reception, seen as a highlight of the format.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "committing crimes was very flavorful and a really powerful way to build a controlling archetype in the format."
- "I think this is one of my favorite things about the format is crimes..."
- "crimes as mechanic added a whole layer to evaluating cards sequencing your cards right figuring out when to play your tal lands that's probably my favorite thing about the format..."
**Key Insights:** Crimes was a successful mechanic, adding strategic layers and enabling specific archetypes effectively.

### Point #12: Spree
**Timestamp:** Point #12
**Current Evaluation:** Felt like a fine, but ultimately minor, modal mechanic (akin to Kicker). It wasn't a major format definer and often felt overcosted.
**Initial Expectations:** Didn't make a huge impact compared to other mechanics.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "spree felt fine as a motal mechanic but it was not a major player in the format."
- "it wasn't even good kicker like it just didn't come up that much."
- "I think in general this could have not been in the the format and the format would not have been substantially different to me."
- "most of the time these were just kind of overcosted effects right you were just paying too much..."
**Key Insights:** Spree was functional but didn't significantly shape gameplay or drafting strategy.

### Point #13: Mounts and Saddle
**Timestamp:** Point #13
**Current Evaluation:** A cool twist on similar mechanics (Vehicles, Enlist). Green-White Mounts unexpectedly became the default best deck in the format.
**Initial Expectations:** Surprised by how powerful the mechanic/archetype turned out to be; didn't initially seem like a top-tier strategy.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "mounts and saddle was a cool Twist on vehicles or enlist those type of mechanics..."
- "green white mounts ended up being the default best deck in the format."
- "I feel like this surprised me a lot like I like after the Scuttle was week one like a green white mounts have you drafted that and I was like no that seems dumb... yeah it is that good."
**Key Insights:** The combination of efficient Mounts, Saddle payoffs (like Miriam), and strong support cards (Throw from the Saddle, Snakeskin Veil) made GW Mounts unexpectedly dominant.

### Point #14: Plot
**Timestamp:** Point #14
**Current Evaluation:** A super smooth, intuitive, and cool mechanic that played beautifully and was a major part of the format. It added sequencing depth but was inherently tempo-negative, making it less suited for aggressive strategies.
**Initial Expectations:** Positive reception, seen as a well-designed mechanic.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "plot was a super smooth mechanic that played beautifully and was a major part of the format."
- "not aggressive not an aggressive mechanic per se but a really cool one..."
- "plot put you significantly behind as far as like your ability to put pressure on the opponent..."
- "I think if if the format had been even a sco slower I think plot could have been much more integral to the format..."
**Key Insights:** Plot was well-executed, offering strategic choices but requiring careful consideration of tempo loss, especially against proactive decks.

## Archetype Performance

### Point #15: Archetype Power Rankings
**Timestamp:** Point #15
**Current Evaluation:**
1.  Green-White Mounts
2.  Green-Black Graveyard
3.  Blue-Black Control
4.  Black-White Grind (noted as a late riser)
5.  Blue-Green Ramp
6.  Blue-White Control
7.  Green-Red Ferocious
8.  Red-White Beats
9.  Red-Black Outlaws
10. Blue-Red Double Spell (noted as weak but drafted often by Ethan)
**Initial Expectations:** Black-White's rise was a late-format discovery. Blue-Red was consistently weak despite attempts to make it work.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "creeping up black white grind I think some people might have that even higher yeah like currently this week..."
- "Blue red double spell that probably might be the worst archetype that I've drafted the most ever yeah."
**Key Insights:** Green-based decks dominated the top tiers, Blue-based control was viable, and Black-White emerged as a strong contender later in the format. Some archetypes (like Red-Black, Blue-Red) consistently underperformed.

### Point #16: Follow Your Rares Over Archetypes
**Timestamp:** Point #16
**Current Evaluation:** Prioritizing drafting and building around powerful rares was often more important than forcing a specific archetype synergy.
**Initial Expectations:** Reinforces the "Prince format" evaluation.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "throw the archetype Power Rankings from the saddle because following your rares and building around them was King."
- "don't be afraid to pick great rares and follow them and and do whatever they want you to do regardless of the color..."
**Key Insights:** In a format defined by powerful rares, flexibility and focusing on enabling your bombs was paramount.

### Point #17: Archetypes Needed Proper Building
**Timestamp:** Point #17
**Current Evaluation:** Many archetypes, especially the more synergy-driven or controlling ones (like Blue decks, Black-White), required very specific builds and card choices to function effectively. Mixing strategies or lacking key pieces was punishing.
**Initial Expectations:** Success required more than just identifying the archetype; precise construction was key.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "Outlaws of Thunder Junction archetypes needed to be built properly or you didn't stand a CH pants."
- "there's so much finicky things of building I think specifically just the blue decks in the format..."
- "we had a Deck Tech in the Discord recently where you were like I think you just have two halves of two different decks here and that's just like a terrible place to be..."
**Key Insights:** Archetypes had specific needs (e.g., finishers in BW, correct balance of interaction/threats in Blue control) that drafters had to identify and fulfill.

### Point #20: Reasons vs. Rewards in Archetypes
**Timestamp:** Point #20
**Current Evaluation:** Many archetype-specific gold uncommons (Intimidation Campaign, Knife Point Demon, Vial Smasher, Crowned Vilecaw, Cacophony Wrangler) were actually *rewards* for already being in that archetype, not strong *reasons* to commit early. This was especially true for archetypes outside the top tiers.
**Initial Expectations:** A shift from potentially first-picking signpost uncommons to prioritizing core removal/threats first.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "a lot of that looked like okay intimidation campaign I'm going to pack one pick one this and draft a deck towards this wrong what you want to do is already have the support for this..."
- "you want you want to first pick your consuming ashes..."
- "the other thing that stands out to me about these gold cards is they're gold cards in archetypes that were not near the top of the power rankings..."
**Key Insights:** Don't overvalue mediocre signpost uncommons early. Build a solid foundation in strong colors first, then pick up synergistic payoffs later. Exception: Top-tier signposts like Miriam Herd Whisper were worth taking early.

---

## Color Power Rankings & Insights

### Point #6: Color Power Rankings
**Timestamp:** Point #6
**Current Evaluation:**
-   **Tier 1:** Green (slightly > Black), Black
-   **Tier 2:** White, Blue (hosts rate Blue highly, maybe = White)
-   **Tier 3:** Red (significant gap below others)
**Reasoning:**
-   **Green:** Best bombs, biggest creatures fastest (stats mattered), good commons (Throw from the Saddle), Desert synergies.
-   **Black:** Deep commons, recursion for bombs, efficient (Exile) removal.
-   **Blue:** The primary control color, effective at enabling late-game strategies.
-   **White:** Best aggressive color (especially with Green), good cheap threats (Trained Arings).
-   **Red:** Weakest overall, lacked impactful threats and removal, mostly a support color.
**Key Insights:** Green was dominant due to size and efficiency. Black offered depth and interaction. Blue enabled control. White enabled aggression. Red lagged significantly behind.

### Point #7: Green's Creatures Were Huge
**Timestamp:** Point #7
**Current Evaluation:** Green's common and uncommon creatures significantly outsized those in other colors, often at efficient rates (factoring in Plot/Desert discounts). This size advantage was a defining feature of the format.
**Initial Expectations:** Green's traditional strength (size) was particularly pronounced and effective in OTJ.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "seriously though Green's cards were huge..." (Lists Giant Beaver, Drover Grizzly, Cactustarantula, Spine-Woods Paladin)
- "they were just bigger than everything else."
- "not only were you getting these larger than every other color body but you were also getting them for pretty good rates."
**Key Insights:** Raw stats mattered significantly, and Green provided the best stats-to-cost ratio, dominating the board.

### Point #11: Crime Dual Lands Evaluation
**Timestamp:** Point #11
**Current Evaluation:** The common dual lands that tapped for mana and could commit a crime were high picks. Green-inclusive and Sultai (Blue/Black/Green) lands were particularly valued.
**Reasoning:** Green lands supported the best color and Desert synergies. Sultai lands supported the primary Crime/Control colors and facilitated splashing bombs in late-game decks.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "the crime dual lands at common were high picksespecially the ones that touched green or the salai colors."
- "green just because best color and a color that like let you Splash a lot..."
- "salai because blue black was where crime committing was at its at its height..."
**Key Insights:** These lands provided fixing, enabled the Crime mechanic, and supported the format's dominant strategies (Green-based decks, multicolor control/splash decks).

### Point #22: Know Your Stance on Green
**Timestamp:** Point #22
**Current Evaluation:** Drafters needed a clear plan regarding Green: how highly to prioritize it, when to fight for it, and when to cede it and draft other colors (like the often-open Blue).
**Initial Expectations:** Recognizing Green's strength and contested nature was key to navigating drafts successfully.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "you needed to know how much you wanted to be green going into the draft..."
- "people are going to remember green was the best and so think you're going to have to know do you want to fight for it or not and and what makes it worth fighting for."
- "I found my comfort Lane drafting blue control decks in the in the latter couple weeks of the format..."
**Key Insights:** Strategic positioning relative to the best color (Green) was a crucial draft skill in OTJ.

### Point #25: Red Was Underpowered
**Timestamp:** Point #25
**Current Evaluation:** Red lacked both effective aggression and strong late-game options. Its threats were often too small, and its removal was comparatively weak. It functioned primarily as a support color.
**Initial Expectations:** Red failed to deliver on typical expectations for aggression or impact.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "red in Outlaws of Thunder Junction wasn't aggressive enough or good enough in the late game just had weak threats and weak removal."
- "it was just a support color and that's fine like we red just usually isn't that..."
- "you didn't want it as your primary color at all I think."
- "Discerning Peddlers like the poster child for why red didn't move like it was just too small ball..."
**Key Insights:** Red was the clear weakest color, lacking a strong independent identity or powerful enough cards to be a primary color choice.

## Card Reassessments

### Point #21: Top 5 Trap Cards
**Timestamp:** Point #21
**Current Evaluation:** Cards that looked promising but consistently underperformed or required very specific homes:
1.  **Patient Naturalist:** Only good in focused GB graveyard decks, otherwise a trap.
2.  **Rakish Crew:** Significantly worse than similar past effects (like Bastion of Remembrance).
3.  **Metamorphic Blast:** Hosts disliked it, viewing it as clunky removal, not a Moldrifter equivalent.
4.  **Crusader of Odric // Arid Archway:** Just didn't perform well.
5.  **Slick Sequence:** Too hard to cast effectively for a minor effect in a format with better card draw.
**Key Insights:** Initial evaluations based on similar past cards or perceived flexibility were often wrong; context and power level mattered.

### Point #24: Top Common of Each Color
**Timestamp:** Point #24
**Current Evaluation:**
-   **White:** Trained Arings (Best common 2-drop, though Mystical Tether also strong)
-   **Blue:** Phantom Interference (Awkward but necessary countermagic)
-   **Black:** Consuming Ashes (Premium Exile removal, better than Vault Plunderer)
-   **Red:** Explosive Derailment (Backbreaking removal, especially when hitting an artifact)
-   **Green:** Throw from the Saddle (Best common overall, efficient removal)
**Key Insights:** Top commons were heavily weighted towards interaction (removal/countermagic), reflecting the need to answer the format's powerful threats.

### Point #26: Putting Cards in the Right Deck (Green Focus)
**Timestamp:** Point #26
**Current Evaluation:** Green cards in particular needed to be in the right *style* of green deck.
-   **Stubborn Burrowfiend:** Best in aggressive/high creature count decks, poor defensively.
-   **Patient Naturalist:** Only for dedicated graveyard decks.
-   **Reach for the Sky:** Surprisingly effective in beatdown decks lacking removal.
**Key Insights:** Even within the best color, card evaluation depended heavily on the specific strategy being employed (aggro vs. ramp vs. graveyard).

### Point #27: Stop Cold Evaluation
**Timestamp:** Point #27
**Current Evaluation:** The most playable version of this type of lockdown effect ever printed, due to Flash and removing abilities.
**Initial Expectations:** Better than previous iterations like Claustrophobia.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "stop cold was the most playable that effect has ever been..."
- "losing the losing all abilities part of this card like I feel like they finally they're like how much do we need to add to this kind of effect to make it good..."
- "removing abilities like getting to lock down Jasper flint and it's not still Milling you... that's huge."
- "it didn't send things to the graveyard so the black decks couldn't recur them..."
**Key Insights:** Adding key features (Flash, removing abilities, bypassing graveyard) finally made this type of effect a strong playable.

### Point #29: Snakeskin Veil vs. Take Up the Shield
**Timestamp:** Point #29
**Current Evaluation:** Snakeskin Veil was significantly better than Take Up the Shield. Veil's hexproof and one mana cost were much more effective against the format's removal (Stop Cold, Mystical Tether) than Take Up the Shield's indestructible and higher cost.
**Initial Expectations:** While both are protection spells, Veil was far superior in context.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "snakes Canin Veil and to a lesser extent take up the shield matched up super well against the removal in the format..."
- "the difference here is that indestructible is not hex proof in this format not hex proof and two Mana versus one Mana..."
- "snakesskin Veil you weren't getting through that at all."
**Key Insights:** The specific nature of the protection (hexproof vs. indestructible) and mana cost made a huge difference in effectiveness against OTJ's interaction suite.

### Point #30: Highway Robbery Evaluation
**Timestamp:** Point #30
**Current Evaluation:** The best "Tormenting Voice" variant ever printed, excellent card selection/advantage, especially in Best-of-Three.
**Initial Expectations:** Highly rated.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "highway robbery is the goat tormenting voice variant this card is awesome..."
- "in best of three highway robbery is excellent."
**Key Insights:** A powerful card filtering/advantage spell that exceeded expectations for its archetype.

### Point #32: Mobile Homestead Evaluation
**Timestamp:** Point #32
**Current Evaluation:** A good early pick that fits well into most decks. Its value lies in enabling splashes, ensuring curve plays, and keeping options open during the draft, more than just its on-board stats.
**Initial Expectations:** Valued more for its draft utility than raw power.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "mobile Homestead is a good early pick that will be above average in most decks..." (quoting Kunnio)
- "I get like the power that it adds is so much more than just what it does on the battlefield but what it enables you to do in the draft right it's much more subtle."
**Key Insights:** Colorless utility cards like Homestead provide strategic flexibility in drafting powerful, potentially multicolor decks.

### Point #33: Outlaw Stitcher Evaluation
**Timestamp:** Point #33
**Current Evaluation:** Looked excellent but ultimately wasn't good enough compared to other strong blue cards. The 1/4 and 2/2 bodies were often irrelevant in a format with large green creatures.
**Initial Expectations:** Disappointing performance compared to preview season hype.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "Outlaw Stitcher should have been excellent and it just wasn't good enough all these other blue cards were better..." (Lists Slickshot Lockpicker, Nimble Brigand, Canyon Crab, Maring Sphinx)
- "that's where the card fails is because that's not close to good enough because neither the 1 14 nor the 2 two are remotely close to being relevant bodies in the format..."
**Key Insights:** Even cards generating multiple bodies can fail if the bodies aren't individually impactful enough for the format's scale.

### Point #34: This Town Ain't Big Enough Evaluation
**Timestamp:** Point #34
**Current Evaluation:** Still a good effect in 2024. The flexibility to be Peel from Reality or a double bounce for tempo made it strong.
**Initial Expectations:** Positive evaluation confirmed.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "peel from reality still good enough in 20124..."
- "sometimes it's just a huge Temposwing to bounce both of your opponent's things..."
- "I I love this town ain't big enough."
**Key Insights:** Flexible bounce spells remain effective tempo tools.

### Point #37: Ruthless Lawbringer Evaluation
**Timestamp:** Point #37
**Current Evaluation:** A late-stage gem and a key non-rare piece for the emergent Black-White grindy archetype.
**Initial Expectations:** Underestimated early on, became crucial as the BW deck was figured out.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "ruthless lawbringer was a late stage Gem of the format black white was was in the dumpster early..."
- "ruthless lawbringer is the key to that deck I think at non rare."
**Key Insights:** Card evaluations can change as archetypes evolve and are better understood throughout a format's lifespan.

### Point #38: Bristlepack Sentry Evaluation
**Timestamp:** Point #38
**Current Evaluation:** Not nearly as good as Drowsing Pteranodon from a previous set. It was playable due to Green being strong, but lacked the same synergy/impact. More of a role-player than a top common.
**Initial Expectations:** Comparison to a similar past card was misleading due to different format context and lack of +1/+1 counter synergies.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "bristle pack Sentry is not drought in Pteranodon who knew context matters..."
- "just Bristal pack Sentry good but good largely off the back of green being very good and not off the back of you know bristle pack Sentry far from a top common..."
**Key Insights:** Context is king; similar cards perform differently based on the surrounding set mechanics and power level.

### Point #39: Wrangler of the Damned Evaluation
**Timestamp:** Point #39
**Current Evaluation:** A great non-rare payoff for control decks, often picked up later in the draft once a blue control shell was established.
**Initial Expectations:** A solid reward/finisher for the archetype.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "Wrangler of the Damned is a great non-rare payoff for a control deck..."
- "this is one of my favorite like I'm getting into I'm navigating my way into a blue control deck... I just knew I was like if Wrangler the dam gets opened I'm gonna see it and I'm gonna get to then have a way to win a game late..."
**Key Insights:** Identifying late-game payoffs appropriate for your archetype is crucial, especially for control strategies.

### Point #40: Golden Egg Award (Best Colorless/Fixing Common)
**Timestamp:** Point #40
**Current Evaluation:** Mirage Mesa wins the award, edging out Conduit Pylon.
**Initial Expectations:** N/A
**Supporting Statements:**
- "the golden egg award for the format goesto Mirage Mesa..."
- "I think Mirage Mesa is just way better than conduit pylon..."
**Key Insights:** Flexible land-based fixing/utility was highly valuable.

### Point #41: Imperial Oath Award (Clunky Overperformer)
**Timestamp:** Point #41
**Current Evaluation:** Cactustarantula. Despite looking "mopy," its sheer size (6/5 for 5 mana with a Desert) and ability to completely stall the ground made it incredibly effective and format-warping.
**Initial Expectations:** Significantly underestimated; hosts admitted to hating on it during previews.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "the Imperial oath award for clunky looking over performer goes to cact tantula..."
- "really bad look for me hating on caar anula in the preview episode..."
- "it just is very good at being mopy like it sits there and the game grinds to a halt when you stick a CA tarantula."
**Key Insights:** Don't underestimate the impact of a large, efficiently costed blocker in a format where ground combat matters, even if the card looks unexciting.

### Point #44: Rise of the Varmints Evaluation
**Timestamp:** Point #44
**Current Evaluation:** A strong card that could mimic Spider Spawning, especially in Sultai shells where it could be flashed back with Slickshot Lockpicker. Better later in the format than early.
**Initial Expectations:** Delivered on its potential as a powerful graveyard payoff.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "rise the varmints did a great impression of spider spawning..."
- "I feel like it delivered..."
- "I think you cracked the code with it being suti rise of the varmints to having slick shot lock Pickers flash it back..."
**Key Insights:** Powerful build-arounds sometimes take time to find their optimal shell and place in the metagame.

### Point #45: Peerless Rope Master Evaluation
**Timestamp:** Point #45
**Current Evaluation:** A decent, replaceable playable that served as a good answer to large Green threats (like Tumbleweeds) and had other niche utility (bouncing own creatures).
**Initial Expectations:** Role-player status confirmed.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "Peerless rope master was a great way to answer large tumble weed Elementals from green decks..."
- "cited this in a lot against Green and honestly like you could just play this main deck..."
**Key Insights:** Even seemingly low-impact commons can find important roles based on format needs.

### Point #46: Skulduggery Evaluation
**Timestamp:** Point #46
**Current Evaluation:** The worst this type of effect (-1/-1 and +1/+1 trick) has ever looked. It lined up poorly against Green's large creatures and the format's overall scale.
**Initial Expectations:** Underwhelming performance for a typically playable trick.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "skull duggery is the worst this effect has ever looked..."
- "sure like skullery looks great against a trained aing in but it looksembarrassing against Anything Green is doing..."
**Key Insights:** Combat tricks are highly context-dependent; Skulduggery was poorly positioned against OTJ's threats.

### Point #47: Outlaws' Fury Evaluation
**Timestamp:** Point #47
**Current Evaluation:** Essentially unplayable. The Red-Black Outlaw aggro deck it supported was not viable.
**Initial Expectations:** A bad take by Ethan initially; the card was indeed terrible.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "Outlaws Fury was definitely not on the job another another bad bad take... for me"
- "this card was I mean there are a few Commons in the set that I feel like I was like that's just literally unplayable I think alas Fury is basically literally unplayable..."
**Key Insights:** Some cards are just fundamentally underpowered for their format.

### Point #48: Top 5 Rares (Based on Experience)
**Timestamp:** Point #48
**Current Evaluation:** (Ethan's list, based on experience, may differ from pure data)
1.  Bonnie Paul, Clear Cutter
2.  Dust Animus
3.  Ornery Tumblewagg
4.  Serapeph Steed
5.  Roxanne, Starfall Savant
**Reasoning/Impact:** These rares were format-defining bombs that often demanded immediate answers or took over the game single-handedly. Dust Animus was noted as particularly frustrating due to its flexibility and resilience.
**Key Insights:** The very top rares had an outsized impact on games, reinforcing the "Prince format" nature of OTJ.
