Okay, here is the analysis comparing the initial takes and retrospective evaluations for the Magic: The Gathering set *Outlaws of Thunder Junction* (OTJ).

## Overview of Analysis: Outlaws of Thunder Junction (OTJ)

This analysis compares early predictions and hot takes about the OTJ Limited format from the Lords of Limited podcast with their later retrospective evaluation after significant experience.

**General Patterns:**
*   Initial takes correctly identified the importance and positive reception of the **Crimes** mechanic and the value of **ETB effects/recursion**.
*   There was a significant underestimation of **Green's** raw power (especially creature size) and the dominance of the **Green-White Mounts** archetype.
*   Conversely, **White** was correctly identified as weak early on, and **Red** was also correctly assessed as underpowered later.
*   The initial feeling that the format was **slower** than recent sets held up in the retrospective, despite potential data contradictions.
*   Evaluations of specific cards saw both hits (Vault Plunderer, Desperate Bloodseeker) and notable misses (Phantom Interference, Cactustarantula, Lone Shark, Take Up the Shield).
*   The impact of **rares** ("Prince Format") was anticipated as a concern and confirmed in the retrospective.

**Most Notable Hits:**
*   Identifying Crimes as a central, powerful, and well-liked mechanic.
*   Recognizing the value of ETB triggers and recursion loops.
*   Correctly pegging Black as the best color initially (though Green caught up/surpassed it).
*   Correctly identifying White as the weakest color early on.

**Most Notable Misses:**
*   Massively underestimating the power level of Green-White Mounts.
*   Underestimating the sheer impact of Green's creature size (Cactustarantula).
*   Initial negative takes on key commons like Phantom Interference and Take Up the Shield proved incorrect in context.
*   Overestimating cards like Lone Shark and potentially Rakish Crew/Raven of Fell Omens.
*   Underestimating the importance of specific removal like Throw from the Saddle.

## Mechanic Assessments

### Committing Crimes
**Initial Take:** A powerful, central, and exciting mechanic with good payoffs and plentiful enablers. Key to increasing win percentage. Easy to trigger naturally or intentionally. High confidence.
**Retrospective Reality:** Very flavorful and powerful, enabling controlling archetypes (often Blue-based). Added significant depth to card evaluation and sequencing. Seen as a highlight of the format. (Point #10)
**Accuracy Analysis:** The initial take was highly accurate. The mechanic was indeed central, powerful, and well-received, adding strategic depth as predicted.
**Key Factors:** The design successfully integrated enablers and payoffs, making it a core part of gameplay.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "committing crimes that is currently the thing I am most excited about the payoffs I think seem great and the ways to trigger them seem plentiful"
- Retrospective: "I think this is one of my favorite things about the format is crimes... added a whole layer to evaluating cards sequencing your cards"
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

### Plot
**Initial Take:** Powerful overall, enabling tempo swings. Significant difference based on cost (2-3 mana plot good, 4-5 mana plot often too slow/tempo-negative). High confidence on potential, Medium on cost sensitivity.
**Retrospective Reality:** Super smooth, intuitive, cool mechanic that played beautifully. Major part of the format, added sequencing depth. Inherently tempo-negative, less suited for aggressive strategies. (Point #14)
**Accuracy Analysis:** Accurate assessment of the mechanic's smoothness, strategic depth, and tempo-negative nature. The cost sensitivity point also seems directionally correct, aligning with the tempo loss concern.
**Key Factors:** The mechanic functioned as designed, offering strategic choices balanced by a clear tempo cost.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "there is a huge difference between things that can plot for two or three Mana versus four or five Mana... you just can't you really can't afford I think to invest four Mana to not impact the board"
- Retrospective: "plot was a super smooth mechanic that played beautifully... plot put you significantly behind as far as like your ability to put pressure on the opponent..."
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

### Mounts and Saddle
**Initial Take:** Playable, but cost-sensitive (cheaper better). Good creatures with Saddle are desirable. Vulnerable to efficient removal. Medium confidence. Specific worry about GW Mounts archetype strength [00:36:45].
**Retrospective Reality:** Cool twist on mechanics. Green-White Mounts unexpectedly became the *default best deck*. Surprised by how powerful the mechanic/archetype was. (Point #13)
**Accuracy Analysis:** The initial take correctly identified cost sensitivity and vulnerability but drastically underestimated the overall power level, particularly the synergy within the GW archetype, which became dominant instead of weak. The specific worry about GW was completely inverted.
**Key Factors:** Underestimation of synergistic payoffs (Miriam), efficient Mounts, and powerful support cards (Throw from the Saddle, Snakeskin Veil) within the GW shell. The raw stats provided by Mounts were better positioned than anticipated.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "the two and three Mana mounts are obviously way better... I still am worried about like mounts are just... they just get owned so hard by the good removal" / "green white mounts I'm very worried about"
- Retrospective: "green white mounts ended up being the default best deck in the format... I feel like this surprised me a lot"
**Verdict:** Mostly Inaccurate

### Spree
**Initial Take:** Not explicitly discussed in detail, but implied focus was on other mechanics.
**Retrospective Reality:** Felt fine, but ultimately minor, like Kicker. Not a major format definer, often overcosted. (Point #12)
**Accuracy Analysis:** N/A - No strong initial take provided for direct comparison, but the lack of initial focus aligns with its minor retrospective impact.
**Key Factors:** The effects offered were often not efficient enough compared to other options in the format.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: N/A
- Retrospective: "spree felt fine as a motal mechanic but it was not a major player in the format... most of the time these were just kind of overcosted effects"
**Verdict:** N/A (No Initial Take)

### W.A.R.P. Outlaw Synergy
**Initial Take:** Mentioned in context of specific cards (Rakish Crew, Shoot the Sheriff) suggesting awareness, but no overall assessment of the synergy's strength.
**Retrospective Reality:** The Outlaw creature type synergy was underpowered and largely irrelevant. (Point #9)
**Accuracy Analysis:** N/A - No direct initial prediction on the overall mechanic strength, though the negative evaluation of Shoot the Sheriff hinted at potential issues.
**Key Factors:** The payoffs for being an Outlaw or having Outlaws weren't strong enough to build around consistently.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: N/A (on overall synergy)
- Retrospective: "wh one out for war PE Outlaw Synergy was underpowered in otj..."
**Verdict:** N/A (No Initial Take)

---

## Format Speed & Gameplay Impressions

### Format Speed
**Initial Take:** Feels slower ("normal speed," "a sco slower") than recent sets like MKM/LCI. More room for catch-up, less punishment for falling behind on board (but stumbling on mana is bad). Medium confidence.
**Retrospective Reality:** Format *felt* slower than recent aggressive formats, despite potential data suggesting otherwise. One-drops generally not good, games often involved slower development. (Point #5)
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly accurate regarding the *feel* of the format speed and the reduced emphasis on hyper-aggression compared to immediate predecessors.
**Key Factors:** Prevalence of Plot (tempo-negative), powerful late-game cards/synergies, and less impactful one-drops contributed to the slower feel.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "the format feels more normal speed to me like a sco slower than we've seen lately"
- Retrospective: "I don't care what the data says otj was one of the slowest formats we've had in a while... this felt different meaningfully different than the formats we've had recently where One Drops Were King"
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

### Aggro Strategy
**Initial Take:** Pure curve-out aggro ("cabs") seems less effective as Plan A. Decks need synergy or reach. Medium confidence.
**Retrospective Reality:** While GW Mounts was the best deck and could be aggressive, pure "cabs" strategies (like RW Beats, RB Outlaws) were indeed ranked lower. The format favored powerful individual cards, synergy (GW, GB), or control (UB, UW) over pure low-curve aggression. Red, the typical aggro color, was weak. (Points #15, #25)
**Accuracy Analysis:** Accurate. Pure aggressive strategies without significant synergy or power outliers were not the dominant force.
**Key Factors:** High power level of individual cards (rares/uncommons), effective removal, and strong blockers (Green creatures) made it hard for simple aggro decks to succeed consistently.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "curving out and smashing... I don't think that is plan a for the best decks in this form it... cabs ain't it in this format I don't think no"
- Retrospective: (Implied by archetype rankings) RW Beats #8, RB Outlaws #9. "Red... wasn't aggressive enough..." (Point #25)
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

### ETB Value & Recursion
**Initial Take:** Good ETBs are highly valuable. Tons of ways to blink, bounce, reanimate to abuse triggers. Grindy value strategies look strong. High confidence.
**Retrospective Reality:** Recursion was prevalent and could be oppressive, especially looping powerful rares (Shepherd, Rutstein, etc.). Black-based graveyard/grind decks (GB, BW) were strong. (Point #36, #15)
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly accurate. The format was indeed defined by powerful ETBs and abundant, effective recursion, leading to grindy games and strong graveyard-focused decks.
**Key Factors:** The density of strong recursion effects (common and uncommon) combined with high-impact ETB creatures (especially rares/uncommons) created powerful loops.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "tons of blinks and bounces and reanimates and just ways to like repeatedly abuse those ETB triggers"
- Retrospective: "there were a lot of ways to recur threats from your graveyard and they all worked well together... the best I think most oppressive Loop was Shepherd of the clouds get back honest rutstein..."
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

### Removal Quality
**Initial Take:** Removal is great, but *only* if efficient *and/or* provides bonus value (crime, life gain, spree, exile). Simple 1-for-1 is less desirable. High confidence.
**Retrospective Reality:** Removal was great and plentiful, especially at common. Necessary to deal with powerful threats. Top commons were often removal spells. (Point #4, #24)
**Accuracy Analysis:** Partially accurate. Removal *was* great and necessary. However, the retrospective emphasized the *quantity* and *necessity* of even basic removal more than the initial take's focus on *bonus value*. While bonus value was good, efficient answers were paramount. The initial dismissal of Explosive Derailment proved incorrect.
**Key Factors:** The high density of must-answer threats (bombs, large creatures) made interaction crucial, even if it was just a simple 1-for-1. Exile was particularly relevant against recursion.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "removal that does nothing else for you I don't think makes the cut here... because there are so many removal spells that give you a bonus"
- Retrospective: "removal is great and plentiful... certainly if there's going to be this many rares and they're going to be this good you're going to need to kill them... the top Commons in each color... it's a lot of removal."
**Verdict:** Partially Accurate

### Bomb Rares/Mythics Impact
**Initial Take:** Ethan worried about "bomb rare roulette" due to density (incl. bonus sheets). Ben more optimistic about commons/uncommons. Medium confidence on both sides.
**Retrospective Reality:** Format was heavily a "Prince Format," favoring decks with powerful rares/uncommons. Success strongly correlated with opening/being passed bombs. Bonus sheets felt like overload. (Point #1, #8)
**Accuracy Analysis:** Ethan's initial concern was highly accurate. The format was significantly defined by the power level and density of rares and powerful uncommons. Ben's optimism about commons/uncommons holding up was less accurate, though good C/U certainly mattered.
**Key Factors:** High power level of rares/mythics across the board, plus multiple bonus sheets adding variance and power spikes.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "I'm worried that this is going to be... just take the card in the upper left corner" (Ethan) / "I also think there's a lot of pushed Commons and uncommons" (Ben)
- Retrospective: "I think this format qualifies [as Prince] you were really disappointed I think if you didn't open a good rare..." / "otj had one too many bonus sheets for our liking..."
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate (Ethan's Concern) / Mostly Inaccurate (Ben's Optimism)

## Color Pair Analysis & Power Rankings

### Color Power Ranking
**Initial Take:** Black >> Blue/Red > Green > White. High confidence on Black #1, White #5. Disagreement on Blue vs Red.
**Retrospective Reality:** Tier 1: Green (> Black), Black. Tier 2: White, Blue. Tier 3: Red. (Point #6)
**Accuracy Analysis:** Mixed. Correctly identified Black as top-tier and White/Red as weaker initially. However, it *massively* underestimated Green, which rose to arguably the #1 spot. Blue ended up Tier 2, while Red was correctly placed at the bottom. The initial confidence in Black #1 and White #5 held up directionally, but Green's position was the major miss.
**Key Factors:** Underestimation of Green's raw stats and synergies (Mounts, Deserts). Overestimation of Red's initial perceived strength. White improved slightly but remained bottom-tier alongside Blue.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: Ben: Black > Blue > Red > Green > White. Ethan: "black and then like two greater than signs before the next color... feel great about white being number five"
- Retrospective: "Tier 1: Green (slightly > Black), Black... Tier 3: Red (significant gap below others)"
**Verdict:** Partially Accurate

### Top Archetypes (Initial vs Final)
**Initial Take:** Impressed by UB, UW, RB, GB, UR. Notes these are mostly Blue/Black based. Low to Medium confidence.
**Retrospective Reality:** Top 5: GW, GB, UB, BW (late riser), UG. Bottom 3: RW, RB, UR. (Point #15)
**Accuracy Analysis:** Mostly inaccurate. While UB and GB were correctly identified as strong, the initial list completely missed the #1 deck (GW) and the late-rising BW. It included several archetypes that ended up weak (RB, UR, potentially UW depending on build). The initial focus on Blue/Black being the *only* top colors was wrong, as Green proved dominant.
**Key Factors:** Underestimation of GW synergy. Overestimation of synergy decks like RB/UR compared to raw power/value decks. BW took time to figure out.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "blue white blue black red black green black and blue red are the ones I've been pretty impressed by"
- Retrospective: "1. Green-White Mounts 2. Green-Black Graveyard 3. Blue-Black Control 4. Black-White Grind... 9. Red-Black Outlaws 10. Blue-Red Double Spell"
**Verdict:** Mostly Inaccurate

### White Archetypes Weakness
**Initial Take:** Concerned about overall strength/identity of White archetypes (BW, RW, GW). Lacks standout commons, synergies feel weak. Best as support in UW Control? Medium confidence.
**Retrospective Reality:** White was ranked Tier 2, below Green/Black but above Red. GW became the *best* deck, contradicting the initial worry. BW became a strong late-format deck. RW remained weak. White's best common (Trained Arings) was good. So, while White overall wasn't dominant, specific archetypes (GW, BW) were much better than feared.
**Accuracy Analysis:** Partially Accurate. The general feeling of White being weaker than G/B held true, but the specific worries about GW and BW were wrong; these became top-tier or strong contenders. The prediction that its best home might be UW Control was also inaccurate, as GW/BW proved stronger.
**Key Factors:** Underestimated GW Mounts synergy. Underestimated BW grind potential (Ruthless Lawbringer). Correctly identified RW weakness.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "I'm worried about the white archetypes... green white mounts I'm very worried about"
- Retrospective: White ranked Tier 2. GW #1 archetype, BW #4 archetype.
**Verdict:** Partially Accurate (Correct on overall lower tier, wrong on specific archetype viability)

## Card Evaluations

### Lone Shark
**Initial Take:** Overrated/Disappointing. Plotting for 4 is too slow, payoff not unique. Medium to High confidence (Ethan).
**Retrospective Reality:** Not explicitly mentioned in the 50 takes, but general sentiment aligns with Plot being tempo-negative, especially higher costs. Its absence from top card discussions supports the initial negative take.
**Accuracy Analysis:** Likely accurate based on the retrospective principles about Plot's tempo cost and the card not emerging as a key player.
**Key Factors:** Tempo loss from high Plot cost was too significant.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "maybe the biggest the biggest mover down for me is Lone shark... you just can't you really can't afford I think to invest four Mana to not impact the board"
- Retrospective: (General Plot discussion) "plot put you significantly behind as far as like your ability to put pressure on the opponent..."
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

### Phantom Interference
**Initial Take:** Underwhelming, easily played around, bad proactively, low pick. High confidence.
**Retrospective Reality:** Awkward but *necessary* countermagic. Top Blue common. (Point #24)
**Accuracy Analysis:** Mostly Inaccurate. While potentially awkward, its necessity in the format made it a crucial card for Blue decks and a high pick, directly contradicting the initial assessment.
**Key Factors:** Underestimated the need for cheap interaction against powerful spells and bombs in slower Blue decks.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "I was very underwhelmed by this... Phantom interference is probably only good in the draw go control decks and if that's the case you're not going to need to pick it that highly"
- Retrospective: "Blue: Phantom Interference (Awkward but necessary countermagic)" - listed as Top Common.
**Verdict:** Mostly Inaccurate

### Desperate Bloodseeker
**Initial Take:** Excellent, bread-and-butter 2-drop for Black. Good stats, lifelink, crime trigger, recursion synergy. High confidence.
**Retrospective Reality:** Not explicitly singled out in the 50 takes, but Black was a top color with deep commons, recursion, and crime synergy, all of which Bloodseeker supports. Its absence from "Trap Cards" suggests it performed as expected.
**Accuracy Analysis:** Likely accurate. It fits the profile of what made Black strong and wasn't flagged as an underperformer.
**Key Factors:** Provided solid stats, relevant abilities (lifelink, crime), and synergy for a top color.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "I think this card is excellent I think it's just like a bread and butter two drop... one of Black's best Commons"
- Retrospective: (General Black discussion) "Deep commons, recursion for bombs, efficient... removal." (Bloodseeker fits this well).
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

### Lively Durge
**Initial Take:** Better than expected due to tutor-to-play mode for 3-4 mana bombs. Potent in the right deck, but not a super high pick. High confidence on improved eval, Medium on pick order.
**Retrospective Reality:** Mentioned as part of the prevalent and sometimes oppressive recursion suite. (Point #36) Fit well into GB graveyard decks (Top 2 archetype).
**Accuracy Analysis:** Accurate. It was a strong recursion piece, particularly potent with bombs, contributing to the power of graveyard strategies. The "potent in the right deck" assessment held true.
**Key Factors:** Flexibility and the power of recurring bombs in a Prince format.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "this just becomes five Mana search that up get it back... and that is extremely powerful"
- Retrospective: Listed alongside Shepherd, Rutstein, Back for More etc. as strong recursion.
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

### Rakish Crew
**Initial Take:** Narrow, effectively a RB gold card. Tempo loss is severe unless heavy Outlaw synergy. High confidence.
**Retrospective Reality:** Listed as the #2 "Trap Card." Significantly worse than similar past effects. (Point #21) RB Outlaws was the #9 archetype.
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly accurate. The card was indeed narrow and underperformed significantly, fitting only into a weak archetype.
**Key Factors:** Tempo loss was too great, Outlaw synergy wasn't strong enough.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "it it's so narrow... playing three Mana for a one one is atrocious... I would say black red gold card"
- Retrospective: "#2 Trap Card: Rakish Crew: Significantly worse than similar past effects"
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

### Raven of Fell Omens
**Initial Take:** Potential "collect them all" build-around. Needs consistent crime triggers (instant speed helps). Could define an archetype. Medium confidence.
**Retrospective Reality:** Grixis synergy stuff (including cards like Raven, Blood Hustler) was generally "too small ball" to compete with Green stats. Not a defining card. (Point #18)
**Accuracy Analysis:** Mostly Inaccurate. While potentially functional in multiples, the strategy it supported wasn't powerful enough in the context of the format's dominant threats and strategies.
**Key Factors:** The format favored raw power and size over incremental "small ball" drain/synergy.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "it felt very catch them all build around at common and if you can do that I think it's going to be good"
- Retrospective: "the grix Synergystuff was just too small ball to compete with the green stats... you really weren't doing it for like Raven ofel Omens..."
**Verdict:** Mostly Inaccurate

### Shoot the Sheriff
**Initial Take:** Bad ("rough") due to high density of Outlaws. Often dead, lacks targets vs Grixis. Sideboard card. High confidence.
**Retrospective Reality:** Not explicitly mentioned in 50 takes, but Black's top common was Consuming Ashes (unconditional exile). The weakness of RB Outlaws and the strength of other colors implies Sheriff wasn't premium. Its absence from top common lists supports the negative initial take.
**Accuracy Analysis:** Likely accurate. The restriction was significant, and better removal options existed.
**Key Factors:** High density of Outlaw creatures, availability of better removal (Consuming Ashes).
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "shoot the sheriff is rough... there are so many good Outlaws... I do not think it is premium"
- Retrospective: (Implied by Consuming Ashes being top common and lack of mention).
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

### Vault Plunderer
**Initial Take:** Incredible common, Inspiring Overseer vibes. Immediate 2-for-1 on a relevant body. Synergizes with recursion. High confidence.
**Retrospective Reality:** Retrospective notes that simple 2-for-1s like Vault Plunderer sometimes felt insufficient because 3-for-1s were so common. Consuming Ashes was ultimately rated as Black's top common over Plunderer. (Point #2, #24)
**Accuracy Analysis:** Partially Accurate. It *was* a very strong common, but the initial "incredible" rating perhaps overstated its impact relative to premium removal (Ashes) and the format's high baseline for card advantage. It wasn't quite Overseer level in context.
**Key Factors:** The format's high card advantage baseline (3-for-1s) slightly devalued simple 2-for-1s. Premium exile removal was more crucial.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "Vault plunderer is incredible... got some inspiring overseer Vibes for sure"
- Retrospective: "my whole journey of trying to figure out why my deck's full of Vault plunderers... just didn't get there..." / "Black: Consuming Ashes (Premium Exile removal, better than Vault Plunderer)"
**Verdict:** Partially Accurate

### Rutstein, Troubled Mogul
**Initial Take:** Extremely strong, possibly "best Gravedigger ever" due to cost reduction. Explosive with recursion. High confidence.
**Retrospective Reality:** Honest Rutstein (assuming this is the same card or closely related) was part of the "most oppressive Loop" with Shepherd of the Clouds. A key piece in powerful recursion strategies (GB was #2 archetype). (Point #36)
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly Accurate. The card was indeed extremely powerful and central to top-tier graveyard strategies.
**Key Factors:** Powerful ETB combined with cost reduction and recursion synergy in a format that supported it.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "best Grave Digger ever truly... it's just explosive"
- Retrospective: "the best I think most oppressive Loop was Shepherd of the clouds get back honest rutstein..."
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

### Silver Deputy
**Initial Take:** Overperformer, especially in Sealed. Fetches basics *or Deserts* (fixing/utility). Mercenary token relevant. Medium to High confidence.
**Retrospective Reality:** Fixing was abundant, enabling splashes and multicolor decks. Desert synergies were relevant (esp. Green). White was a key part of the best deck (GW). (Point #43, #6) While not singled out, its role fits the format's description.
**Accuracy Analysis:** Likely Accurate. Provided fixing and utility in a format where both were valuable, contributing to multicolor strategies and potentially enabling Desert synergies or GW decks.
**Key Factors:** Abundant fixing, value of Deserts, relevance of Mercenary tokens.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "certainly an over performer... being able to fetch up deserts I think is big game"
- Retrospective: "otj had tons of fixing available... a lot of the decks ended up feeling supy... partially because if you wanted to Splash you could"
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

### Arid Archway // Crusader of Odric
**Initial Take:** Archway is insane/nuts, potentially unpassable. Mana accel, card advantage, selection, crime replay. High confidence.
**Retrospective Reality:** Crusader of Odric // Arid Archway listed as #4 "Trap Card," just didn't perform well. (Point #21)
**Accuracy Analysis:** Completely Wrong. The initial hype was massively off; the card significantly underperformed expectations.
**Key Factors:** Likely too slow or clunky in practice compared to other options. The opportunity cost of bouncing a land and the specific requirements might have been underestimated.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "erid Archway is nuts... might be unpassable it's so good"
- Retrospective: "#4 Trap Card: Crusader of Odric // Arid Archway: Just didn't perform well."
**Verdict:** Completely Wrong

### Take Up the Shield
**Initial Take:** Likely bad/overrated. "Small ball," vulnerable, format maybe not aggressive enough. Ben "horrifically underwhelmed." High confidence (negative).
**Retrospective Reality:** Snakeskin Veil was significantly better. Take Up the Shield's indestructible wasn't as good as hexproof vs. common removal (Stop Cold, Tether), and two mana was too much. (Point #29)
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly Accurate. The initial negative assessment and reasoning (vulnerability, cost, format context) proved correct.
**Key Factors:** Hexproof > Indestructible vs. format removal. One mana > Two mana for protection.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "this card is on notice from me... significant notice... creatures plus take up the shield is so small ball... I was horrifically underwhelmed"
- Retrospective: "snakes Canin Veil... was significantly better than Take Up the Shield... indestructible is not hex proof... and two Mana versus one Mana..."
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

### Hardbristle Bandit
**Initial Take:** Terrible, a mulligan. Complete reversal from an even earlier positive thought. High confidence (negative).
**Retrospective Reality:** Not mentioned in 50 takes, but Green's strength came from huge stats and efficient threats/removal, not 1/1 mana dorks. Its absence supports the negative take.
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly Accurate. Mana dorks are often weak in modern Limited, and this one offered little upside in a format about board presence and power.
**Key Factors:** Low impact body, format didn't reward small mana dorks.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "this card is a mulligan this card's terrible it's really bad... don't pick hard Crystal Bandit"
- Retrospective: (Implied by Green's focus on size/efficiency).
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

### Rise of the Varmints
**Initial Take:** Strong late game, splashable. Plotting helps. Good even with moderate graveyard count (3-4 tokens). Best in BG. High confidence.
**Retrospective Reality:** Did a great impression of Spider Spawning. Delivered on potential. Best in Sultai (with Slickshot Lockpicker flashback). Better later in format. (Point #44)
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly Accurate. Correctly identified its strength, splashability, late-game potential, and primary home (BG/Sultai).
**Key Factors:** Powerful token generation payoff for graveyard strategies in a format where games could go long.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "rise of the varmints I'm here for it yeah I I mean... it's good it's splashable and the games go long"
- Retrospective: "rise the varmints did a great impression of spider spawning... I feel like it delivered..."
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

### Make Your Own Luck
**Initial Take:** Excellent, "Mold Drifter level." Significant card advantage/selection. Great even without hitting bombs. High confidence.
**Retrospective Reality:** Poster child (along with Plan the Heist) for "Three-for-Ones are the New Two-for-Ones." Extremely common and impactful card advantage source. (Point #2)
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly Accurate. Correctly identified as a top-tier card advantage spell, defining the format's high baseline for value.
**Key Factors:** Provided raw card quantity and selection efficiently in a format that valued grinding.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "you said this is mold Drifter levels of good yeah it is okay this card is just mold Drifter... this card is excellent"
- Retrospective: "shout out to I think the poster Childs for these are plan the heist and make your own luck..."
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

### Intimidation Campaign
**Initial Take:** Disputed. Ben: Strong in long games. Ethan: Clunky, maybe too slow. Low confidence due to disagreement.
**Retrospective Reality:** Listed as a "Reasons vs. Rewards" card - a *reward* for being in UB, not a reason to commit early. Implies it was playable but not a top-tier pull into the archetype. UB Control was the #3 archetype. (Point #20, #15)
**Accuracy Analysis:** Partially Accurate (leaning towards Ethan's caution). It wasn't a bomb pull into the archetype but a payoff once you were there. Ben was right games went long, but Ethan's "clunky" assessment seems closer to its role as a reward rather than a primary reason.
**Key Factors:** Required setup and being in the right archetype, making it less impactful as an early pick compared to core removal/threats.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: Ethan: "I don't think it's that good... it's a little clunky" / Ben: "You're wrong I've played with it games go long"
- Retrospective: "a lot of that looked like okay intimidation campaign I'm going to pack one pick one this... wrong what you want to do is already have the support for this..."
**Verdict:** Partially Accurate

### Cactustarantula (Not explicitly in Early Takes, but related to Green eval)
**Initial Take:** N/A (but retrospective notes hosts hated on it initially). General underestimation of Green's size.
**Retrospective Reality:** Imperial Oath Award winner (clunky overperformer). 6/5 for 5 with Desert was format-warping, stalling grounds completely. (Point #41)
**Accuracy Analysis:** N/A (No specific early take, but highlights a major blind spot). The retrospective admission of hating it initially shows a significant miss in evaluating raw stats.
**Key Factors:** Underestimation of how impactful a huge, efficiently costed blocker could be in the format context.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: N/A
- Retrospective: "really bad look for me hating on caar anula in the preview episode... it just is very good at being mopy like it sits there and the game grinds to a halt"
**Verdict:** N/A (Significant Miss admitted in Retrospective)

## Patterns and Insights

*   **Mechanic Feel vs. Power Level:** Initial takes were often good at predicting the *feel* and *strategic depth* of mechanics like Crimes and Plot, but sometimes missed their raw power level impact relative to other format elements (e.g., underestimating Mounts synergy).
*   **Underestimation of Raw Stats (Green):** A major blind spot was underestimating the sheer effectiveness of Green's oversized creatures at common/uncommon (Giant Beaver, Cactustarantula). The heuristic that synergy > stats was inverted in OTJ.
*   **Context is King (Traps & Overperformers):** Comparisons to past cards were often misleading (Rakish Crew, Bristlepack Sentry). Cards performed based on OTJ's specific context (removal types, dominant threats, speed). Cards that looked clunky (Cactustarantula) or situational (Snakeskin Veil) overperformed due to format needs, while seemingly solid cards (Vault Plunderer, Phantom Interference initially) had nuanced evaluations based on context.
*   **Prince Format Impact:** The early concern about rares was validated. This skewed evaluations, making efficient answers (removal) more critical and sometimes overshadowing traditional value engines (simple 2-for-1s).
*   **Archetype Evolution:** Some archetypes took time to optimize (BW Grind), while others predicted to be strong failed to materialize (RB Outlaws, UR Spells). Initial archetype reads based on signposts were less reliable than understanding the core strengths of colors (Green size, Black recursion/removal).
*   **Fixing Abundance:** The ease of splashing enabled by common fixing (Crime Lands, Green fixing, Deserts) was perhaps underestimated initially and contributed to the "multicolor soup" feel noted in the retrospective.

## Conclusion

The initial predictions for Outlaws of Thunder Junction captured some key aspects accurately, particularly the positive reception and strategic depth of the Crimes mechanic, the value of recursion, and the format feeling slower than its predecessors. Black was correctly identified as a top color early on.

However, there were significant misses, primarily centered around a massive underestimation of Green's raw power (especially creature size) and the resulting dominance of the Green-White Mounts archetype. Conversely, initial worries about GW proved entirely wrong. Evaluations of specific cards also showed considerable variance, with some accurate calls alongside major misevaluations (Arid Archway, Phantom Interference, Cactustarantula). The format being heavily influenced by rares ("Prince Format") was correctly anticipated as a potential issue.

Lessons for future evaluations include: paying close attention to raw stats-to-cost ratios (especially in Green), being wary of assuming past card performance translates directly, understanding how format speed and dominant threats shape the value of interaction and specific mechanics, and acknowledging that archetype strength can evolve significantly as a format matures. The impact of high rare density and bonus sheets continues to be a critical factor influencing format dynamics.
