Okay, let's analyze the accuracy of the early takes on Duskmourn: House of Horror compared to the later retrospective.  

## Duskmourn: House of Horror - Prediction Accuracy Analysis  

**Overview:**  
This analysis compares early predictions and evaluations of the Duskmourn: House of Horror (DUS) Limited format, made after initial play experiences (Early Access/Pre-release), with a comprehensive retrospective conducted after extensive play (Lords of Limited Episode 400).  

**General Patterns:**  
The early takes correctly identified the format's core tension between aggressive strategies (particularly White-based) and powerful late-game engines (driven by Rooms). However, the initial assessment significantly underestimated the individual power and pervasiveness of Room cards while overestimating the strength and ease of the dedicated Manifest Dread strategy. Several key archetypes (RW Aggro, UW Tempo) were correctly identified as strong early on, while others (GW Survival, BW Reanimator) were accurately pegged as weak. There were notable misses on individual card evaluations, both over- and under-estimations, with synergy and format context proving crucial. The retrospective confirms the format's depth, balance, and beloved status, aspects not fully captured in the early, more polarized (Aggro vs. Rooms) view.  

**Most Notable Hits:**  
*   Identifying Red-White Aggro and Blue-White Tempo as top-tier aggressive decks early.  
*   Correctly predicting Green-White Survival and Black-White Reanimator would be weak archetypes.  
*   Recognizing the power of Oblivious Bookworm (living up to hype).  
*   Identifying the importance of creatures with two types for Delirium.  

**Most Notable Misses:**  
*   Initially underestimating the raw power and ubiquity of individual Room cards (while correctly identifying the *potential* of a "Rooms deck").  
*   Initially overestimating the strength/ease of Manifest Dread as a core strategy compared to Rooms.  
*   Significantly undervaluing Spine-Seeker Centipede (calling it "homeless" vs. retrospective "best Green common").  
*   Overvaluing Miasma Demon initially.  
*   Underestimating the difficulty of assembling the dedicated "UR Rooms" deck despite the power of individual Rooms.

## Mechanic Assessments  

### Rooms  
**Initial Take:** Much stronger than initially expected, format-defining late-game engine. Good Rooms provide excellent value, act as mana sinks, trigger Eerie, and push the format towards Aggro vs. Late Game poles. The "Rooms deck" wins the late game hard.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Rooms were indeed powerful new split cards. Individual Room cards were generally strong and synergistic (especially with Eerie). However, the dedicated UR "Rooms deck" was hard to assemble effectively because the best Rooms were highly contested and required premium defensive speed.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** The initial take correctly identified the *individual power* of Room cards and their impact on the format's dynamic (pushing towards aggro vs. late game). It also correctly identified their synergy with Eerie. However, it overestimated the ease and dominance of assembling a dedicated "Rooms *deck*," which the retrospective clarifies was difficult due to high demand for key pieces.  
**Key Factors:** Initial focus on the power of the mechanic's ceiling vs. the practical difficulty of assembling the optimal synergistic deck in draft.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "we were way too low on rooms so I think rooms are just good cards... the rooms deck wins the late game so hard"  
- Retrospective: "rooms were a new split card type and they were P powerful... that take [UR Rooms blowing everyone out] didn't turn out to pan out... but the rooms themselves... rooms are great cards... the rooms deck rarely came together because everyone wanted the really good rooms."  
**Verdict:** Partially Accurate  

### Manifest Dread  
**Initial Take:** Weaker than initially expected. Not intrinsically powerful, needs specific support (Delirium, UG payoffs). More fragile and deck-building constrained than thought. Reliant on cheap creatures surviving.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Considered a success on flavor and synergy, integrating well with Delirium. Posed interesting deckbuilding puzzles (creature density). Functioned as both A+B synergy and general value/enabling. Not explicitly called fragile, but the deckbuilding challenge was noted.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** The initial take correctly identified that Manifest Dread wasn't intrinsically powerful and required specific synergistic homes (like Delirium) and careful deckbuilding. It accurately captured the mechanic's reliance on synergy rather than raw power. However, calling it "weaker than expected" and "fragile" might slightly undersell its eventual role as a successful and integral part of several viable strategies (GB, Teamer). The retrospective frames it more positively as a "win."  
**Key Factors:** Initial focus on raw power vs. synergistic potential. Deckbuilding complexity correctly identified early.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "it's not just intrinsically powerful like it is synergistically powerful... figuring out how to build manifest dread decks optimally is going to be I think a big piece of the puzzle"  
- Retrospective: "manifest dread was a win on flavor and Synergy... bleed with delirium we've already talked about that's so cool... deck building requirements this was something I was really having a hard time with early on..."  
**Verdict:** Mostly Accurate  

### Eerie  
**Initial Take:** Stock way up because Rooms are good and trigger it frequently. Makes Eerie decks (like UW) much more viable. Non-once-per-turn triggers are powerful.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Eerie synergized effectively with Rooms, enabling cool and potentially explosive archetypes (especially UW). The full potential (e.g., Scavenger + Rotunda) wasn't obvious pre-play. Weaker Rooms became playable due to Eerie synergy.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** This was a highly accurate re-assessment. The early take correctly linked Eerie's viability directly to the strength of Rooms and identified UW as a key beneficiary. The retrospective confirms this strong synergy and the explosive potential.  
**Key Factors:** Correctly identifying the crucial link between the two mechanics (Rooms enabling Eerie).  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "I think rooms being good cards makes Erie a lot better... Eerie stock goes way up along with room stock going way up"  
- Retrospective: "Eerie goes hand in hand with rooms as a cool archetype that could really pop off... didn't quite know how explosive optimistic scavenger into elegant rotunda was going to be..."  
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate  

### Survival  
**Initial Take:** Underperforming, weak mid-range strategy. Struggles on the draw, lacks good common two-drops, requires enabling attacks, gets outclassed by Rooms. Bottom-tier archetype.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Survival fell flat as a mechanic and archetype (GW). Attacking mechanics not directly helping the attack are tough. Its failure might have beneficially balanced the format by preventing White aggro dominance across three pairs.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** This prediction was spot-on. The early take correctly identified the mechanic's weaknesses and the archetype's poor positioning in the format. The retrospective confirms its failure and even posits a potential positive side effect for format balance.  
**Key Factors:** Understanding fundamental challenges with attack-based mechanics that don't provide immediate payoff or enablers. Recognizing its poor matchup against late-game strategies.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "I'm pretty down on Survival... it's not a good aggro deck and it's not a good late game deck... if you don't win quickly you just know you're losing to Rooms"  
- Retrospective: "Survival fell flat as a mechanic and an archetype in green white... mechanics about attacking that don't help you attack are tough... I think it's a boon for the format that this archetype didn't pan out."  
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate  

### Delirium  
**Initial Take:** Viable, especially in GB (low Tier 1). GR aggro version is weak. Enabling requires care (multi-type creatures are key).  
**Retrospective Reality:** Easiest Delirium ever due to multi-type creatures, yet still offered interesting choices. Crucial for format success. Enabled by various card types and interactions.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** The early take correctly identified GB as the best home and GR as weak. It also correctly highlighted the importance of multi-type creatures for enabling it. While the retrospective emphasizes how *easy* it was, the early take's focus on needing the *right* cards aligns with this. The assessment of its viability was accurate.  
**Key Factors:** Recognizing the importance of specific enablers (multi-type creatures). Correctly assessing the relative strength of different color pairs utilizing the mechanic.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "I still think [Black Green Delirium is] good... [Green-Red Delirium] the Commons just aren't good enough... if you are delirium you really want cards that are artifact creature or enchantment creature"  
- Retrospective: "delirium was the easiest it's ever been to achieve... putting in the artifact creatures the enchantment creatures all that sort of stuff was just a huge win for the format."  
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate  

### Reanimate (Black-White)  
**Initial Take:** Underperforming, clunky, requires drawing pieces in order, vulnerable to common removal, doesn't overlap well, payoff isn't always enough. Bottom tier.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Functioned more as value recursion (recurring answered threats) than cheating bombs. Required a mental shift from typical Reanimator. Exile removal was key counterplay. BW was viable but part of the "Unique Decks" bucket, not top tier.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** The early take correctly identified BW Reanimator as weak and clunky ("bottom tier"). The retrospective confirms it wasn't a top strategy, though it frames its function differently (value recursion vs. combo). The core assessment of its low power level was accurate.  
**Key Factors:** Recognizing the archetype's inherent clunkiness and vulnerability to interaction in this specific format context.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "not close to a tier one archetype I think certainly towards the bottom of the archetypes"  
- Retrospective: "reanimate was less about cheating threats into play and more about reliably recurring them... BW Reanimate [listed under 'Unique Decks' bucket, not the top tier ones]"  
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

## Archetype Predictions / Color Pair Analyses  

### Overall Format Dynamic (Aggro vs. Late Game/Rooms)  
**Initial Take:** Format defined by tension between strong aggro (RW, UW) trying to get under powerful late-game Rooms decks (UR, 5c). Mid-range squeezed unless very strong (GB).  
**Retrospective Reality:** The format was highly balanced with 9/10 archetypes viable. While strong aggro and powerful late-game decks existed, the "squeezed middle" wasn't as pronounced due to the overall depth and viability of synergistic decks across the spectrum (GB Delirium, Teamer, RB Sac, etc.). The "buckets" description suggests more diversity than a simple Aggro vs. Control dichotomy.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** The initial take correctly identified the *existence* of strong poles (Aggro and Rooms-style late game). However, it likely overstated the degree to which the format was *defined* solely by this tension, underestimating the viability and strength of synergistic mid-range and unique decks highlighted in the retrospective.  
**Key Factors:** Early play often reveals the most extreme strategies first. The format's depth and balance across multiple archetypes became clearer with more experience.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "pushes the format towards the opposite ends of the spectrum... being in the middle is a really tough spot to be"  
- Retrospective: "Duskmourn is considered one of the most balanced, intricate, and widely beloved draft formats... 9 out of 10 archetypes were viable... know which bucket of DUS more and you're drafting..."  
**Verdict:** Partially Accurate  

### Red-White Aggro  
**Initial Take:** Huge overperformer, top tier (#1/#2). Numerous ways to push damage, leverages "power 2 or less" well. Best Bo1 deck.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Acknowledged as a strong archetype where early commitment could pay off. Key cards/combos (MVS + Fear) mentioned. However, not listed in the retrospective's "slight Notch Above the Rest" tier (which included UW, RB, GB, Teamer). Still clearly a very viable and powerful deck.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly accurate in identifying RW Aggro as a potent force that was initially underestimated. While the retrospective might place a few other decks *slightly* higher at the absolute peak, the early take correctly identified RW as a defining and top-performing aggressive strategy throughout the format.  
**Key Factors:** Recognizing powerful common synergies and aggressive potential early.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "red white has shot up to number one or number two yeah... the deck is really good"  
- Retrospective: "[White-based aggro decks (UW, WR) were the most common archetypes where early commitment could pay off]" (Implied strength) / Mentions key RW cards like MVS, Fear of Being Hunted.  
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate  

### Blue-White Tempo/Aggro  
**Initial Take:** Very impressive, strong tempo/aggro deck. Eerie is good, plays good Rooms, strong synergy. Top-tier aggro. Potential for control builds too.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Identified as one of the "slight Notch Above the Rest" decks (UW Eerie Tempo). Eerie/Rooms synergy highlighted (Scavenger + Rotunda). Shard Mage's Rescue interaction noted as key. Considered a top archetype.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** Extremely accurate. The early take correctly identified UW's strength, its core strategy (Eerie/Tempo/Rooms), and its top-tier status, all confirmed by the retrospective.  
**Key Factors:** Correctly identifying the power derived from Eerie + Rooms synergy early on.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "blue white on the other hand has been very impressive it seems like a super strong Tempo aggro deck... I would have that very high up on the list of aggro decks"  
- Retrospective: "the decks in the format that were a slight Notch Above the Rest... blue white Eerie Tempo..."  
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate  

### Green-Black Delirium  
**Initial Take:** Still very good, likely best mid-range option, low Tier 1.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Identified as one of the "slight Notch Above the Rest" decks. A core "bucket" of the format. Brood Spinner (gold uncommon) highlighted as a top card pushing the archetype.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** Accurate. Both takes place GB Delirium among the format's best decks, recognizing its strength and viability.  
**Key Factors:** Correctly identifying a synergistic archetype with strong gold uncommon support.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "green black I still think very good... it's still in your in your tier one"  
- Retrospective: "the decks in the format that were a slight Notch Above the Rest... green black delirium..."  
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate  

### Blue-Red Rooms  
**Initial Take:** Premier late-game strategy, top tier (often splashing to 5c). Leverages the power of Rooms.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Individual Rooms were powerful, but the dedicated UR "Rooms deck" rarely came together optimally due to high demand for key cards and need for defensive speed. While *variants* involving Rooms were strong (Teamer, splashing), the pure UR deck wasn't as dominant/consistent as the early take implied.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** Partially accurate. It correctly identified Rooms as a powerful late-game element and UR as a potential home. However, it overestimated the consistency and dominance of the dedicated UR archetype itself, which the retrospective clarifies was hard to assemble. The success was more in decks *using* good Rooms rather than a specific UR Rooms archetype dominating.  
**Key Factors:** Overestimation of archetype consistency based on individual card power.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "blue red rooms SL five color room soup like blue red denoting rooms dominance" (in Tier 1 list)  
- Retrospective: "despite rooms being powerful the rooms deck rarely came together because everyone wanted the really good rooms."  
**Verdict:** Partially Accurate  

### Red-Black Sacrifice  
**Initial Take:** Felt pretty good, likely best built aggressive. Benefits from sacrificing enchantments/Rooms. Solid Tier 2.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Identified as one of the "slight Notch Above the Rest" decks. Key gold uncommon (Disturbing Mirth) ranked highly. RB Kindling (1-drops) noted as crucial enablers.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** The initial take *underestimated* RB Sac. While correctly identifying its viability and general strategy, placing it in Tier 2 was too low compared to the retrospective, which elevates it to the top cluster of decks.  
**Key Factors:** Perhaps underappreciating the power of the gold uncommon or the efficiency of the sacrifice synergies early on.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "I think red black is still good not tier one but I'd put it in tier I like it in tier two"  
- Retrospective: "the decks in the format that were a slight Notch Above the Rest... red black sacrifice..."  
**Verdict:** Mostly Inaccurate (Underrated its tier)  

### Color Power Rankings  
**Initial Take:** 1. Red, 2. Blue, 3. White, 4. Green, 5. Black (Complete reversal from pre-play). Driven by Rooms/Aggro.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Tentative ranking: Red > Green > Blue > White > Black, but heavily caveated as not very useful due to high balance. Black and Blue potentially underrated overall. Synergy mattered more than raw color power.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** The early take's ranking (R > U > W > G > B) differs significantly from the retrospective's tentative one (R > G > U > W > B), especially regarding Green's placement. More importantly, the retrospective emphasizes the *lack of utility* in such rankings due to high balance, a nuance missed in the more decisive early take. The early take correctly identified Red and Blue's strength based on top archetypes but misevaluated Green and Black's relative standing and the overall importance of color ranking itself.  
**Key Factors:** High format balance makes simple color rankings less meaningful than archetype strength. Early takes might overemphasize colors involved in the currently perceived "best" decks.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: Lists R > U > W > G > B ranking with confidence.  
- Retrospective: "Color Power Rankings not really a super helpful way to approach duskmourn... black and blue might have been the most underrated... I think this is the least practical or least helpful it's ever been to do so [provide color rankings]."  
**Verdict:** Mostly Inaccurate

## Card Evaluations  

### Spine-Seeker Centipede  
**Initial Take:** Still good, but not a pull into Green. Small ball, homeless, competes with Greenhouse. Confidence: High.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Identified as the Top Common in Green.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** This is a major miss. The early take drastically undervalued the card, dismissing it as niche and replaceable, while the retrospective identifies it as the single best common in its color.  
**Key Factors:** Failure to appreciate its efficiency, role in Delirium, and impact in Green-based decks. Perhaps over-focusing on late-game Room strategies initially.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "I just again like I thought this was going to pull you into green and I don't think it should it's a little bit small ball for the format... it is a little bit homeless kind of yeah"  
- Retrospective: "Top Commons... Green (Spine Seeker Centipede)."  
**Verdict:** Completely Wrong  

### Most Valuable Slayer  
**Initial Take:** The real deal for aggressive red decks, like Combat Professor. Confidence: High.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Initially overrated (compared to Combat Professor) but remained solid (#3 Red common). 4-mana cost held it back slightly. Still good, better than Fear of Being Hunted P1P1.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** The initial take was overly enthusiastic ("real deal," "Combat Professor"). The retrospective provides a more measured view, acknowledging it's good but not quite the format-defining bomb initially suggested, mainly due to mana cost. Directionally correct (good card), but magnitude was off.  
**Key Factors:** Cross-format comparisons can be misleading (Combat Professor was 3 mana). Format context (speed, other options) matters.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "that card is the real deal for red Decks... you called it combat professor and I think that's right"  
- Retrospective: "most valuable Slayer was I think again simultaneously overrated... we all thought that was going to be the nuts right we're talking about that as combat Professor... didn't quite pan out... it's a solid number three [Red common]"  
**Verdict:** Partially Accurate  

### Glimmer Light
**Initial Take:** Tight, efficient package, very good in UW Eerie Tempo. Broad applications ("golden egg-y"). Confidence: High.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Received the "Golden Egg" award for best colorless glue card. Fit into every deck (fixing/filtering). Initially underrated by the community but highly rated by hosts early. Value recognized over time.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly accurate. The early take correctly identified its efficiency, key role in decks like UW, and its general utility ("golden egg-y"), all confirmed by the retrospective.  
**Key Factors:** Recognizing the value of cheap, flexible colorless cards that provide fixing and minor advantage.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "it is just a tight efficient little package that is I think very good in the format... I still feel pretty good about my take on this being golden egg-y"  
- Retrospective: "the golden egg award goes to I'm going glimmer light... glimmer light really did could go in every deck."  
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate  

### Oblivious Bookworm  
**Initial Take:** (Not explicitly evaluated in provided Early Takes text, but context implies it was recognized as strong, driving UG).  
**Retrospective Reality:** Lived up to significant pre-set hype ("LeBron James"). Immediate value, overwhelming advantage if unchecked. Strong even outside dedicated Manifest Dread decks. Top 2 gold uncommon.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** While not a direct comparison point in the provided text, the retrospective confirms the card was hyped early and *did* live up to it, aligning with the general sentiment around powerful gold uncommons.  
**Key Factors:** Repeatable card selection/advantage is inherently powerful.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: (Implied high value in UG discussion) "oblivious Bookworm is just great"  
- Retrospective: "Oblivious Bookworm... was hyped leading in and lived up to the hype all format long... Brood Spinner, 2. Oblivious Bookworm [in Top Gold Uncommons]"  
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate (Based on retrospective confirming early hype was justified)  

### Miasma Demon  
**Initial Take:** Way too high initially (B+/A-). Now C/C+ at best. Rarely have enough cards to discard for impact. Much worse than 7-drop Edict. Confidence: High (on the re-evaluation).  
**Retrospective Reality:** Not specifically mentioned in the retrospective's highlights, suggesting it indeed settled into a lower tier and wasn't a format-defining card.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** The early *re-evaluation* appears accurate. The hosts correctly identified their initial overestimation and adjusted downwards to a level (C/C+) that seems consistent with the card not being a major player in the final format analysis.  
**Key Factors:** Overestimating the impact of the discard ability without considering typical hand sizes in the late game.  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "we were way too high on this... this is a c at best C+"  
- Retrospective: (Absence of mention suggests it wasn't a key card)  
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate (on the corrected take)  

### Land Cyclers  
**Initial Take:** Blue/Green ones actively desirable in Manifest Dread decks for big bodies. Might want 3-4 total.  
**Retrospective Reality:** Praised as perfectly balanced – impactful but not broken, flexible. Value varied, good mana-smoothing/late threats, pseudo-18th land. Ranking: B > G > R > U > W. Value in Manifest Dread noted.  
**Accuracy Analysis:** The early take correctly identified a key niche for the Blue/Green cyclers (Manifest Dread payoffs). The retrospective confirms their overall utility and balance, noting the Manifest Dread angle as one aspect of their value. The early take focused on one specific use case but was right about that use case.  
**Key Factors:** Recognizing specific synergies (flipping big bodies with Manifest Dread).  
**Quotes:**  
- Initial: "I do think the blue and green one stock have gone up quite a bit and I do think you actively want copies of those in Manifest Destiny [Dread] decks"  
- Retrospective: "the land cyclers the perfect amount of playable and Powerful... Ethan: '...started to to sell me was having them as just random things you could flip up in manifest dreed decks...'"  
**Verdict:** Partially Accurate (Correct on UG use case, missed broader utility)

## Patterns and Insights  

*   **Archetype Consistency vs. Card Power:** Early takes sometimes conflated the power of individual cards/mechanics (like Rooms) with the ease of drafting a consistently powerful deck around them. The retrospective often clarified that while cards were strong, assembling the *perfect* synergistic deck was challenging.  
*   **Aggro Identification:** The early takes were quite successful at identifying the strongest aggressive archetypes (RW, UW) and correctly dismissing weaker ones (GW, GR). Aggressive strategies often reveal their power level relatively quickly.  
*   **Synergy Appreciation:** While some synergies were identified early (Eerie + Rooms), the full depth and impact of others (Cursed Recording, specific Manifest Dread builds, value-Reanimate) took longer to appreciate, as highlighted in the retrospective. Cards initially dismissed (like Spine-Seeker Centipede) found crucial synergistic roles.  
*   **Mid-range Nuance:** The initial "squeezed middle" assessment was too simplistic. The retrospective showed that strong synergistic mid-range decks (GB, Teamer, RB) were among the format's best, not just outliers.  
*   **Common Evaluation:** There were significant swings in common evaluation (Spine-Seeker Centipede, Meat Locker // Drowned Diner). Early takes might over-focus on obvious power/stats, while later evaluations better incorporate synergy and format context.  
*   **Gold Uncommon Impact:** Both takes recognized the power of gold uncommons, but the retrospective solidified their role as primary drivers of the top archetypes.  
*   **Re-evaluation is Key:** The "Early Takes" document itself is an example of necessary re-evaluation after initial impressions ("Crash Course"). The comparison shows that even that early re-evaluation needed further refinement as the format matured.

## Conclusion  

The early takes on Duskmourn, made after initial play, demonstrated a good grasp of the format's aggressive potential and correctly identified several key strong and weak archetypes. The core tension between aggro and late-game Rooms was recognized. However, there was a tendency to overestimate the consistency of synergistic decks based on the power of their components (especially UR Rooms) and to misjudge the relative power levels of the core mechanics (Rooms vs. Manifest Dread initially).  

Significant misses occurred in evaluating specific commons, highlighting the difficulty of assessing cards outside of deep format context and established synergies. The retrospective revealed a more balanced and nuanced format than the early, more polarized view suggested, with greater depth across various synergistic strategies. Overall, the early predictions were directionally useful but required significant refinement, underscoring the importance of extensive play experience for truly understanding a complex and balanced Limited format like Duskmourn. The biggest lesson is perhaps the difficulty in predicting archetype *consistency* versus simply identifying powerful cards or mechanics early on.
