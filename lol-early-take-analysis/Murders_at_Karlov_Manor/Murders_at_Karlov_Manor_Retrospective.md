## Format & Play Booster Impact

### Take 1: Draft is Not Dead - Play Boosters Successful Debut
**Timestamp:** 00:05:50  
**Current Evaluation:** The first Play Booster format was awesome and great for draft.  
**Initial Expectations:** Ben was nervous/reserved, Ethan cautiously optimistic. Both agree it worked out well.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "this was awesome this was a great format yeah"  
- "I think just the increase in uncommons really lets them I think cook a little bit and increases the lifespan the shelf life of draft formats for junkies like you and me"  
**Key Insights:** Play Boosters delivered a positive draft experience, potentially increasing format longevity due to higher uncommon density and interesting pack texture.  

### Take 2: The Wheel is Kind of Dead - Reduced Pack Size Impact
**Timestamp:** 00:07:18  
**Current Evaluation:** Wheeling cards is significantly less common and more variable due to one fewer card per pack.  
**Initial Expectations:** Implicitly compared to Draft Boosters where wheeling was more reliable.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "you really do feel the one card missing from play boosters in certain packs"  
- "there's a bit more variance there also right because it has to be like that card has to be in like the first two maybe three packs"  
**Key Insights:** The smaller pack size in Play Boosters makes wheeling good cards less frequent and less predictable, altering draft signaling and pick expectations.  

### Take 3: MKM Primarily a Synergy Format (with Good Rares)  
**Timestamp:** 00:09:00  
**Current Evaluation:** The format strongly rewarded either opening powerful rares or finding an open synergistic lane. Finding the open lane was generally preferred.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly stated, but emphasizes the format's dual nature.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "it's really hard to end up not in one of two camps the one Camp is you open something really powerful and you get to maximize that or you find a very open Lane and you maximize that"  
- "I'm just so much more interested in finding the open color pair"  
**Key Insights:** Success in MKM draft often came from committing fully to either a bomb rare or, more ideally, a clearly open synergistic archetype.  

### Take 13: Drafts Rewarded Delaying the Decision - Staying Open Valued  
**Timestamp:** 00:22:00  
**Current Evaluation:** Staying open, often by focusing heavily on one color early, was highly rewarded due to powerful rares and synergistic archetypes. Taking gold cards early felt riskier.  
**Initial Expectations:** A shift away from eagerly taking gold signposts early.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "drafts rewarded you for delaying the decision thanks to powerful rares and synergistic archetypes"  
- "rest in peace happily taking gold cards early for me at least certainly the sign posts"  
- "this is one of the formats I've wanted to start out heavy in one color like more than I can remember in in recent memory"  
**Key Insights:** The structure of MKM (synergy, powerful rares, double signposts per pair) incentivized staying flexible longer and avoiding early commitment to a color pair via gold cards.  

### Take 16: Early Picks Had Huge Ripple Effects - High-Impact Decisions  
**Timestamp:** 00:25:20  
**Current Evaluation:** The first few picks (1-4) felt extremely impactful, setting a strong direction and making subsequent choices carry significant weight.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not stated, but highlights the perceived weight of early decisions in this format.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "Picks one through four had a huge ripple effect on where you were likely to end up"  
- "starting at pick one like right there you see it case versus perimeter enforcer like you're making a huge call about where you want to end up"  
- "you really felt Ripple effects from okay taking this gold card like kind of wasted a pick and you you don't like wasting picks because there's one less card in the pack"  
**Key Insights:** The combination of synergy focus, powerful cards, and fewer picks per pack made the initial draft choices feel particularly consequential.  

### Take 50: MKM Was a Darn Good Debut for Play Boosters  
**Timestamp:** 00:57:00  
**Current Evaluation:** While not necessarily an all-time great set, MKM was a very successful and fun first implementation of Play Boosters.  
**Initial Expectations:** High stakes for the first Play Booster set.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "murders at Carl Manor was not an all-timer but it was a darn good debut for play boosters Amen to that"  
- "I appreciate this format I appreciate them crushing it with play boosters I think that was probably a tall order and I it was a really fun draft format"  
**Key Insights:** MKM successfully navigated the transition to Play Boosters, providing an enjoyable and well-regarded draft experience.

## Mechanic Evaluations  

### Take 6: Ward 2 on Disguise Creatures Mattered Significantly  
**Timestamp:** 00:11:00  
**Current Evaluation:** Ward 2 on disguise creatures was highly impactful, fundamentally changing removal evaluation and combat, enabling a 3-mana 2/2 format to work.  
**Initial Expectations:** Some skepticism about whether a format centered on 3-mana 2/2s could work in modern Magic.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "War[d] 2 changed the game like cuz you couldn't just fire off shock for like infinite value and get ahead"  
- "they sized things in the format so that they could trade early but then late game could flip up and be relevant"  
- "people thought going into the format that like there's no way you can make a three Mana 22 format in 2024 and they did but they did did yeah"  
**Key Insights:** Ward 2 was a crucial design choice that protected early plays, made removal less efficient against face-down creatures, and created interesting gameplay decisions around flipping creatures.  

### Take 7: Removal Evaluation Shifted Due to Ward 2  
**Timestamp:** 00:12:15  
**Current Evaluation:** Good removal needed to either trade profitably with disguise creatures (e.g., Shock, Long Goodbye) or provide additional value (e.g., Makeshift Binding, Case of the Burning Masks, Bite Down on Crime). Standard removal like Murder felt less appealing.  
**Initial Expectations:** Standard removal evaluation metrics needed adjustment.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "removal had to do one of two things to be worthwhile... one I think it had to trade profitably with disguise... or give you something in addition"  
- "murder is not a card I'm excited about at all"  
- "even something like Galvanize which should yes by all rights be a premium Magic the Gathering card was pretty average because it was four Mana to kill a disguise creature"  
**Key Insights:** The prevalence and Ward cost of disguise creatures devalued expensive, single-target removal and prioritized efficiency or added value.  

### Take 8: Clue Tokens Were Back and Excellent
**Timestamp:** 00:13:30  
**Current Evaluation:** Clue generation was a powerful and desirable mechanic throughout the format. Cards like Novice Inspector were format-defining.  
**Initial Expectations:** Clues are generally good, but their impact was very high here.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "clue tokens were back and as good as ever"  
- "novice inspector wow what a card"  
- "[Locksley] Eaves dropper... the car[d] was great"  
**Key Insights:** Efficient clue generation provided significant card advantage and smoothed draws, making clue-producing cards high picks.  

### Take 9: Suspect Played Out Beautifully, but Minor Role  
**Timestamp:** 00:16:00  
**Current Evaluation:** Suspect was a well-designed, clean mechanic that created interesting gameplay decisions on both offense and defense, though it wasn't a central pillar of the format.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not specified, but positive reception.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "suspect played out beautifully on offense and defense but was ultimately a fairly small part of the format which I think is fine"  
- "I really liked I really liked suspect it was just very clean"  
- "if you chose wrong like if you were choosing I think that also had pretty significant impacts on gameplay decisions"  
**Key Insights:** Suspect added tactical depth without dominating the format, proving to be a successful minor mechanic.  

### Take 10: Collecting Evidence Was a Win for Late Game Mechanics  
**Timestamp:** 00:17:15  
**Current Evaluation:** Collecting Evidence was a successful, viable, and engaging late-game mechanic, particularly rewarding graveyard synergies (especially in Golgari/Simic) without feeling clunky.  
**Initial Expectations:** Often graveyard mechanics can be too slow or difficult; this one worked well.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "collecting evidence was a win for late game mechanics everywhere you love to see it"  
- "this was great this was great and it was cool and competitive and like just hard enough to draft that you couldn't like do it all the time"  
- "just collecting evidence was good like on something like bite down on crime... the Mana discount or the bonus you got from it was also quite good"  
**Key Insights:** Collecting Evidence provided meaningful payoffs for graveyard setup and strategic deckbuilding, making late-game strategies engaging and powerful.  

### Take 11: Cases Were Flavorful and Good Role-Players  
**Timestamp:** 00:19:20  
**Current Evaluation:** Cases were a flavor win and served as solid, synergistic rewards in their respective archetypes, generally being good mid-pack picks rather than bombs (at uncommon).  
**Initial Expectations:** Not specified.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "cases were a flavor win and they were great rewards to pick up in their respective Synergy archetypes"  
- "it wasn't nice that they weren't like totally busted they just felt like a nice okay I'm in detectives and I got this late detective case"  
- "most the non- rares were mostly Niche which I think was cool"  
**Key Insights:** Cases successfully filled a design space as flavorful, archetype-specific payoffs that felt rewarding but not overpowered at lower rarities.  

### Take 21: Hybrid Disguise Creatures Were Balanced Fillers  
**Timestamp:** 00:31:00  
**Current Evaluation:** The hybrid disguise creatures were flexible but generally landed in the "filler" or "solid playable" category rather than being high picks, offering balance despite their flexibility. Dog Walker was the premium exception.  
**Initial Expectations:** Went in thinking they might be very high picks due to flexibility.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "the hybrid disguise creatures were another huge win for the format and a huge win in that they were balanced right"  
- "didn't we we went in thinking like oh wow these are all going to be such high picks because they're so flexible and they were not"  
- "that flexibility almost landed in a filler territory Beyond those those top premium ones like dog walker"  
**Key Insights:** The hybrid disguise creatures provided fixing and flexibility without being overly powerful, contributing positively to the format's balance.  

---  

## Color & Archetype Performance  

### Take 4: MKM Was a White or Green Format (Primarily)  
**Timestamp:** 00:10:00  
**Current Evaluation:** The format felt centered around White and Green, meaning you ideally wanted to start your draft in one of these colors as they offered the most pivot points and defined strategies (White = faster, Green = longer).  
**Initial Expectations:** Not specified, but identifies the core color pillars.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "murders Carlo Manor was a celesia format but it was ultimately fairly balanced... not exactly celesia right like but more that like it was a white or green format like that's where we want it to start"  
- "I think white or green gave you the most pivot Points in this format too"  
**Key Insights:** White and Green were the foundational colors, offering the strongest starting points and strategic directions in the format.  

### Take 5: MKM Color Power Rankings  
**Timestamp:** 00:10:40  
**Current Evaluation:** Final Color Rankings: 1. White, 2. Green, 3. Red/Blue (tied), 4. Black. All colors were viable.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not specified, represents final assessment.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "in first we have white in second we have green in third red tied with blue in fourth and last but I think certainly not least is black"  
- "anything's viable among these colors among the color pairs I think"  
**Key Insights:** Clear tiering of colors emerged, with White and Green at the top, but the format remained balanced enough for all colors to be playable.  

### Take 12: Archetype Power Rankings  
**Timestamp:** 00:20:30  
**Current Evaluation:** Final Archetype Rankings: 1. RW, 2. UG, 3. UW, 4. GW, 5. UR, 6. GB, 7. BW, 8. RG, 9. RB, 10. UB. All were playable, with potential gaps in power between tiers. Splashing was possible but required prioritization.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not specified, represents final assessment.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- Lists the ranking explicitly.  
- "all quite playable"  
- "I also liked that aspect of it too that it felt it didn't feel plentiful and it didn't feel impossible [splashing] it felt like if you you just had to say to yourself moving to pack two I'm prioritizing Escape tunnel"  
**Key Insights:** A clear hierarchy of archetypes emerged, led by Red-White aggro and Blue-Green value, but all pairs could succeed, and splashing remained a viable strategy with effort.  

### Take 14: Decks Rewarded Having a Clear Goal  
**Timestamp:** 00:23:30  
**Current Evaluation:** Successful decks had a well-defined plan for how and when they intended to win the game (e.g., aggro closing quickly, control grinding value). Understanding your deck's role and power level relative to opponents was crucial.  
**Initial Expectations:** General principle, but emphasized in this synergistic format.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "Murders At Carlo Manor decks rewarded you for having a clear goal for when and how you were trying to end the game"  
- "just having a clear idea of what your deck's power level was certainly maybe in the rare Department"  
- "making sure you clearly Target okay my plan is this to try to get the game over with and I'm going to work really hard towards that"  
**Key Insights:** The format's nature required players to identify their deck's strategic identity (aggro, midrange, control, synergy) and draft/play accordingly to maximize its strengths.  

### Take 15: Needed to Decide How Hard to Fight for White  
**Timestamp:** 00:24:30  
**Current Evaluation:** Given White's strength and popularity, drafters needed a conscious strategy regarding whether to prioritize it heavily early (like taking Perimeter Enforcer P1P1) or be prepared to pivot if it wasn't open.  
**Initial Expectations:** White looked strong early, confirmed by experience.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "you needed to know how hard you were willing to fight for white going into drafts"  
- Discusses the P1P1 choice between Case of the Locked Hothouse (Green) and Perimeter Enforcer (White).  
- "do you want to be white pick or not to me and like yeah I I I want to be white so I'm going to try"  
**Key Insights:** White's desirability created a key strategic tension in drafts, forcing players to assess risks and rewards of committing to the color.  

### Take 18: Blue-Green (Simic) Was Excellent
**Timestamp:** 00:27:50  
**Current Evaluation:** Blue-Green was a top-tier (#2) archetype, powered by outstanding gold signposts (Evidence Examiner, Repulsive Mutation), strong late-game payoffs, clue synergies, and flexibility to play aggressively or defensively.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not specified, but clearly emerged as a powerhouse.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "shout out to Blu green... it's so good"  
- "the two signposts evidence examiner and repulsive mutation are excellent just incredible"  
- "it had the tools to get to the late game and it had great late game payoffs"  
- "out cold was part of that too right like that was out Cold's best home was blue green"  
**Key Insights:** The combination of powerful gold cards, synergistic commons/uncommons (clues, collect evidence), and strategic flexibility made Blue-Green a dominant force.  

### Take 24: Roots/Outline Deck Recipe - High Creature Count Needed  
**Timestamp:** 00:34:00  
**Current Evaluation:** The Golgari (and sometimes Sultai) Insidious Roots / Chalk Outline deck required a specific recipe: high creature count, the key enchantments, ways for creatures to leave the graveyard (self-mill, collect evidence, recursion), and some interaction. Failure to assemble all pieces made the deck fragile.  
**Initial Expectations:** Initial uncertainty on how to make the deck work consistently.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "to make the roots outline deck work you needed a high creature count"  
- Lists requirements: "payoffs you needed outline in Roots", "ways for creatures to leave the yard", "ways to collect evidence or you needed maabre reconstruction"  
- "if any of those pieces were slightly off... I'm a little nervous for how good you're your roots outline deck is going to be"  
**Key Insights:** The popular Roots/Outline synergy deck was powerful but demanding in its construction, requiring careful drafting to ensure all necessary components were present, especially a high density of creatures.  

### Take 25: Blue-Red Artifacts Had Fastest Starts  
**Timestamp:** 00:35:30  
**Current Evaluation:** The Blue-Red artifact/improvise deck was capable of the most explosive, potentially unbeatable starts in the format when it came together, though it could be high-risk/high-reward to draft.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not specified, but highlights the archetype's ceiling.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "blue red artifacts was capable of the fastest most unbeatable starts in the format"  
- Recounts examples of broken starts (Jm Mz's sealed deck, personal draft experience).  
- "I think high risk High reward to draft but the reward was definitely there"  
**Key Insights:** While potentially inconsistent, the Blue-Red artifact archetype possessed the highest ceiling for explosive, game-ending openings.

## Card Reassessments  

### Take 8 Addendum: Novice Inspector > Dog Walker  
**Timestamp:** 00:13:45  
**Current Evaluation:** Ethan concedes Ben was right: Novice Inspector is ultimately better than Dog Walker.  
**Initial Expectations:** This was a point of disagreement during the Crash Course/early format.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I think at at the end of the day when all is said and done you were right novice inspector over dog walker yes" (Ethan)  
- "The thing about novice inspector is is that weirdly it's splashable"  
**Key Insights:** Novice Inspector's efficiency, card draw, and surprising splashability edged it out over the flexible but less impactful Dog Walker in the final assessment.  

### Take 8 Addendum: Locksley Eavesdropper Was Great
**Timestamp:** 00:14:30  
**Current Evaluation:** Locksley Eavesdropper significantly overperformed initial skepticism and was a great card.  
**Initial Expectations:** Ethan was initially low on the card ("super wrong on that car[d]"), comparing it unfavorably to Selfless Packmate.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "locks on EES dropper I know that was a big disagreement between us in the crash course... I was super wrong on that car the car was great"  
- "it's hard because you're like well this is like self's packmate except it doesn't have fortel and you have to pay the two Mana to draw the card it's like just doesn't matter"  
**Key Insights:** The format context (3-mana 2/2s making a 4-mana 3/3 reasonable, value of clues) made Eavesdropper much better than direct comparisons to similar cards from other sets suggested.  

### Take 17: Premium Removal Was Excellent Due to Rares  
**Timestamp:** 00:26:50  
**Current Evaluation:** Efficient premium removal (Makeshift Binding, Shock, Torch the Witness, Hard-Hitting Question) was crucial for dealing with the format's powerful rares. Having ~3+ pieces was desirable.  
**Initial Expectations:** Standard importance of removal, perhaps heightened by rare quality.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "premium removal was excellent because of the rares running around"  
- "efficiency there just being able to take out a lot of the threats was was awesome"  
- "you wanted like three efficient removal spells something something in that neighborh[ood] at a minimum"  
**Key Insights:** The density and power level of rares in MKM made having access to efficient answers particularly important.  

### Take 19: Good Twos Scarce, Good Fours Abundant
**Timestamp:** 00:29:50  
**Current Evaluation:** Drafting good two-mana creatures was difficult and crucial, while four-mana plays (like On the Job, Out Cold) were plentiful. Prioritizing twos was key.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not specified, but a key format dynamic.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "good twos were hard to find and good fours were everywhere"  
- "the way that both of those cards [Out Cold, On the Job] fail is when you don't have enough twos"  
- "there's just there's just no shortage of ways to leverage good twos and no shortage of four drops"  
**Key Insights:** The scarcity of strong two-drops compared to the abundance of powerful four-drops created a draft tension where securing early plays was paramount.  

### Take 20: Top Commons Reassessment
**Timestamp:** 00:30:30  
**Current Evaluation:** Final Top Commons: White: Novice Inspector, Blue: Projector Inspector, Black: Extract a Confession, Red: Shock, Green: Nervous Gardener (early draft) / Locksley Eavesdropper (later/synergy), Hybrid: Dog Walker (though Ben still thinks it's slightly overrated).  
**Initial Expectations:** Generally aligns with strong early impressions, solidifies rankings.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- Explicitly lists the top commons.  
- Discussion on Gardener vs Eavesdropper nuance.  
- Continued friendly debate on Dog Walker's exact power level.  
**Key Insights:** Confirms the dominance of efficient clue-makers and removal at common, with Green offering context-dependent choices.  

### Take 22: Leering Onlooker is Lingering Souls (on Defense)  
**Timestamp:** 00:31:50  
**Current Evaluation:** Leering Onlooker played a role similar to Lingering Souls, providing excellent defensive value and graveyard synergy.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not specified, but a strong endorsement.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "shout out to you learing onlooker is lingering Souls I I would say with a caveat of on defense this is a defensive card yes"  
- Discussion of surveilling it into the graveyard with Sanitation Automaton or Rubblebelt Maverick.  
**Key Insights:** Leering Onlooker provided significant value, especially defensively and in graveyard-focused decks, exceeding typical common expectations.  

### Take 23: Build-Arounds Are Back (Chalk Outline / Insidious Roots)  
**Timestamp:** 00:33:00  
**Current Evaluation:** Chalk Outline and Insidious Roots were powerful and exciting build-around uncommons that defined a potent archetype.  
**Initial Expectations:** Uncertainty if they would work consistently.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "build arounds are back I mean the big two the big Headliners are chalk outline and Insidious Roots"  
- "wasn't sure if they were going to work initially like I missed the pieces that you needed to really make them tick"  
**Key Insights:** These uncommons enabled a unique and strong synergy deck, marking a successful return of impactful build-arounds.  

### Take 27: On the Job Was Excellent (Overrun Effect)  
**Timestamp:** 00:38:15  
**Current Evaluation:** On the Job was a premium card for White-based go-wide decks, effectively acting as an Overrun that also drew a card (made a clue).  
**Initial Expectations:** Looked good, confirmed as excellent.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "overrun is back on the job really tied the room together for white go wide decks"  
- "turns out the way to make overrungood is to tack on draw card but I it would have been good in this format without making a clue"  
- "premium card absolutely premium for the w[h]o white decks"  
**Key Insights:** On the Job provided a powerful finisher for aggressive white decks, enhanced significantly by the clue generation.  

### Take 28: Best Rares (Aurelia, Doppelgang, Ezrim, Coat, Izoni)  
**Timestamp:** 00:39:10  
**Current Evaluation:** Izoni, Center of the Web felt like the most impactful/memorable rare, though Doppelgang, Ezrim, Cryptic Coat, and Aurelia's Vindicator were also top-tier. Overall, the rares felt powerful but beatable and well-distributed.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not specified, but a positive assessment of the rare design.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "aoni center of the web was the best rare in a set full of good rares yeah I mean Doppel gang not too far behind"  
- Lists other top rares/mythics.  
- "usually I am complaining about rares I loved the rares in this format... powerful you could still beat them there was good removal sign me up"  
**Key Insights:** MKM featured numerous powerful rares that shaped games, but the environment provided answers, leading to a positive reception of the rare slot.  

### Take 29: Escape Tunnel Good, Public Thoroughfare Bad  
**Timestamp:** 00:40:15  
**Current Evaluation:** Escape Tunnel was a valuable early pick for fixing and enabling splashes, crucial due to double-pip requirements and the desire for flexibility. Public Thoroughfare was generally not good enough.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not specified.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "Escape tunnel was good fixing public thoroughfare was not so much"  
- "it honestly probably should have been somewhere in our top 10 Common pick order I think"  
- "your double color requirements in decks was real in two color decks"  
**Key Insights:** Escape Tunnel proved to be essential fixing in a format with demanding mana costs and splash incentives, while Public Thoroughfare's drawback was too costly.  

### Take 30: Other Nonbasics Were Pretty Bad  
**Timestamp:** 00:41:20  
**Current Evaluation:** Scene of the Crime was deemed unplayable due to vulnerability. Branch of Vitu-Ghazi remained underwhelming despite some pushback.  
**Initial Expectations:** Initial assessment of Branch was low, remained low. Scene of the Crime seen as too risky.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "other than Escape tunnel the nonbasic lands were pretty bad"  
- "scene of the crime you can't pay me to put that card in a deck"  
- "Branch of V2 gazi... our gut was right like not a great card"  
**Key Insights:** Outside of Escape Tunnel, the nonbasic land cycle offered little upside and significant risks or downsides.  

### Take 31: Undercity Eliminator / Cornered Crook Not Flame Tongue Kavu  
**Timestamp:** 00:42:15  
**Current Evaluation:** These disguise creatures with ETB removal effects underperformed expectations, largely due to Ward 2 making their targets harder to kill efficiently. Cornered Crook was surprisingly better than Eliminator due to stats and ability to go face.  
**Initial Expectations:** Potential for strong 2-for-1 value, like FTK.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "under City Eliminator and cornered crook were not flame tongue Kavu the W[ard] two effects really put a pinch on these"  
- "Corner crook was not on my bingo card of being better than Eliminator absolutely was because it could go face"  
- "intellectually I know these were not good cards in the format but but like years and years of limited training like still makes me like I think well it's it's got to be good right"  
**Key Insights:** The format context (Ward 2) significantly weakened these potential value creatures compared to historical analogues.  

### Take 32: Even "Lesser" One-Drops Were Good/Playable  
**Timestamp:** 00:43:15  
**Current Evaluation:** One-drops beyond Novice Inspector, like Rubblebelt Maverick and Snarling Gorehound, were effective role-players in their respective decks.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not specified.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "even the One Drops that looked less good than something like novice inspector were still good good or playable"  
- "Rubble Bel Maverick was excellent"  
- "snaring gorehound like maybe like just a really effective piece of a lot of the black decks"  
**Key Insights:** The format supported several viable one-mana creatures beyond the obvious standout.  

### Take 34: Push/Pull Deserves Respect - Highly Flexible & Powerful  
**Timestamp:** 00:45:15  
**Current Evaluation:** Push/Pull was an incredible, highly flexible uncommon due to its hybrid nature and powerful effects (especially Pull). Its value was often underestimated.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not specified, but strong current endorsement.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "Push Pull is incredible... it deserves your respect because of how flexible it is as an early pick"  
- "Pull gets cast way more often... pull ends so many games"  
- "I think to this day the I like people's understanding of this card is largely um lost a little bit"  
**Key Insights:** Push/Pull's flexibility as an early pick combined with the high impact of its modes made it one of the best uncommons, potentially underrated by the wider player base.  

### Take 35: Out Cold Better Than Lost in the Maze  
**Timestamp:** 00:46:40  
**Current Evaluation:** Out Cold proved to be the better combat trick/tempo play compared to Lost in the Maze, despite Lost in the Maze having some niche blowout potential.  
**Initial Expectations:** Ethan took time to come around to this view.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "at the end of the day out cold was better than lost in the Maze which took me I think probably too long to get on board with"  
- "alcohol's just better it is just better"  
**Key Insights:** Out Cold's consistent tempo advantage and board impact outweighed the situational protection/blowout potential of Lost in the Maze.  

### Take 36: Connecting the Dots - Narrowly Powerful, Overhyped Initially?  
**Timestamp:** 00:47:20  
**Current Evaluation:** Ben believes the card is much narrower than they initially assessed (mostly just for Red-Black) and might have been overrated. Ethan agrees it's narrow and rarely played but maintains it's powerful *when* it fits and works. Ben suggests an apology might be owed for initial hype.  
**Initial Expectations:** They were initially very high ("came in hot") on the card, faced pushback (17lands data), and defended it. Now reassessing.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- (Ben) "I think it's a lot more narrow then we initially said and I think think we owe our listeners an apology"  
- (Ben) "it's really just a red black gold card in my mind"  
- (Ethan) "I agree that it is narrow but it is narrowly powerful... when I have played it which is rarely it has been excellent"  
**Key Insights:** Initial enthusiasm for Connecting the Dots was tempered by experience; it's a powerful effect in specific, narrow contexts (primarily RB) but not a generally strong pick.  

### Take 37: A Killer Among Us - Fun Mind Game  
**Timestamp:** 00:48:50  
**Current Evaluation:** The card played out fine ("played like a dream"), with the choice mini-game being a fun, if slightly time-consuming, element.  
**Initial Expectations:** Looked like a meme.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "a killer Among Us looked like a meme but played like a dream"  
- Discussion about the mental energy spent choosing the hidden creature type.  
**Key Insights:** The card was playable, and the hidden information aspect added a unique (though perhaps mentally taxing for some) element.  

### Take 38: Slimy Dualleech Better Than Nightdrinker Moroi  
**Timestamp:** 00:49:50  
**Current Evaluation:** Slimy Dualleech was a playable card with a home (Black-White), whereas Nightdrinker Moroi was true filler.  
**Initial Expectations:** A previous point of contention, now settled.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "slimy dual Leach better than night Drinkermoroy yes I yes"  
- "night Drinker maroy was true filler um and slimy Dule was not like better than filler but like not premium or anything but it had a home"  
**Key Insights:** Confirms Dualleech's status as a reasonable playable over the disappointing Moroi.  

### Take 39: Not on My Watch - Bad Fit for White Decks  
**Timestamp:** 00:50:15  
**Current Evaluation:** The card was actively bad ("abysmal") because its defensive, conditional nature clashed with what White decks typically wanted to do (be proactive).  
**Initial Expectations:** Not specified, strong negative assessment now.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "not on my watch more like not in my deck please that card is abysmal"  
- "it just is like completely at the opposite with what white is trying to do"  
- Contrasts it unfavorably with Push/Pull due to timing restrictions and lack of flexibility.  
**Key Insights:** The card's restrictions and defensive posture made it a poor fit for the generally aggressive White strategies in MKM.  

### Take 41: Ezrim, Agency Chief Can Sacrifice Any Artifact
**Timestamp:** 00:50:45  
**Current Evaluation:** A small but relevant rules interaction: Ezrim can sacrifice any artifact (like Sanitation Automaton) for hexproof, not just clues.  
**Initial Expectations:** N/A - rules clarification.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "ezam agency Chief can sacrifice any artifacts not just Clues got a sanitation automaton hanging around that that can give ezim hex proof baby"  
**Key Insights:** Understanding the full flexibility of powerful rares like Ezrim is important.  

### Take 42: Golden Egg Award (Best Glue Common) - Split Decision!  
**Timestamp:** 00:50:55  
**Current Evaluation:** A tie! Ben awards it to Sanitation Automaton (higher floor, lower ceiling, goes in any deck). Ethan awards it to Gravestone Strider (cooler, higher ceiling, essential for Green/late-game/synergy decks).  
**Initial Expectations:** N/A - final award.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- (Ben on Automaton) "your argument was that sanitation automaton goes in more decks and I I would agree because it's it's just a worse card... higher floor and a lower ceiling"  
- (Ethan on Strider) "the decks where you do play gravestone Strider which is not like which is a fair amount of them... gravestone strer is just such a cool card"  
**Key Insights:** Both cards filled crucial "glue" roles. Automaton offered universal utility and flexibility, while Strider provided powerful synergy and late-game inevitability in specific strategies.  

### Take 43: Some Real Stinker Rares Existed  
**Timestamp:** 00:52:15  
**Current Evaluation:** Alongside the powerful rares, there were several truly bad ("stinker") rares and mythics (Officious Interrogation, Treacherous Greed, Relive the Past, Case of the Ransacked Lab, Undergrowth Recon). This is seen as healthy for the Play Booster environment.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not specified.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "there may not be unplayable Commons anymore but there were some real stinkers at rare"  
- Lists the specific cards.  
- "stinkers stinkers but that that is good with the amount of rears and mythics that they're sticking into packs too correct it's nice to have like it's nice to have tension"  
**Key Insights:** The inclusion of low-power rares adds variance and tension to pack opening, which is considered a positive aspect of the Play Booster model.  

### Take 44: White's Common Depth Was Incredible  
**Timestamp:** 00:53:40  
**Current Evaluation:** White had an exceptionally deep roster of strong, synergistic commons. Even cards ranked lower down the list (like Seasoned Consultant) were excellent.  
**Initial Expectations:** White looked strong, depth confirmed by experience.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "White's deep roster of Commons cannot be understated"  
- "shout out to seasoned consultant which is like I don't know White's eth best common and is still an absolute Banger"  
- "they all work so well together they have a clear plan"  
**Key Insights:** The sheer number of high-quality, synergistic commons contributed significantly to White's dominance in the format.  

### Take 45: Gearbane Orangutan Has Reach  
**Timestamp:** 00:54:20  
**Current Evaluation:** Simple reminder: the monkey has reach.  
**Initial Expectations:** N/A - rules reminder.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "gear Bane orangutan has reach"  
**Key Insights:** Don't forget key abilities on creatures!  

### Take 46: Coveted Falcon Similar to Faerie Snoop (Underwhelming)  
**Timestamp:** 00:54:25  
**Current Evaluation:** Coveted Falcon, despite its unique text box, largely played like a Faerie Snoop – a decent defensive body that draws a card, but generally underwhelming.  
**Initial Expectations:** Falcon's unique ability might have suggested higher potential.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "corporate wants you to find the difference between these two cards coveted Falcon and fairy Snoop"  
- "coveted Falcon is mostly also just a three Mana one4 that draws you your card"  
**Key Insights:** Complex or unique abilities don't always translate to high power level; the Falcon's base stats and function were its primary contribution most games.  

### Take 47: Clue Weapons Were a Gameplay Fail  
**Timestamp:** 00:55:25  
**Current Evaluation:** The cycle of equipment that could be sacrificed to investigate ("Clue Weapons") were universally bad and undesirable.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not specified.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "The Clue weapons were a flavor win but a gameplay fail like not not a one of them no did you want to play like truly just bad just bad"  
**Key Insights:** This cycle of cards completely missed the mark on power level.  

### Take 48: Imperial Oath Award (Clunky Overperformer) - Crowd Control Warden / Vengeful Creeper / Topiary Panther  
**Timestamp:** 00:55:40  
**Current Evaluation:** No single card truly matched Imperial Oath's level, but Crowd Control Warden is nominated as a clunky card that significantly overperformed expectations (Ethan took time to come around). Vengeful Creeper (always had targets) and Topiary Panther (OG Buffalo) also mentioned as honorable mentions/possibilities.  
**Initial Expectations:** Warden looked mediocre ("meh whatever"). Creeper/Panther likely underestimated initially.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I don't know control Warden like there's really not one like there is not a card that is that expensive that is close to as good as Imperial oath"  
- (Ethan on Warden) "I really took a long time to come around to this is anything other than like me whatever but like it is huge"  
- (Ben on Creeper) "honorable mention goes vengeful creeper for me... just found that to be like it just always had targets which was impressive"  
- "I think topiary Panther is in the conversation too"  
**Key Insights:** Several expensive/clunky cards proved much better than they looked, with Crowd Control Warden being a prime example of a card whose impact exceeded initial evaluations.
