## Overview  

This document extracts predictions, evaluations, and hot takes regarding the Magic: The Gathering set **Murders at Karlov Manor (MKM)** based on the provided podcast transcript featuring Ben and Ethan. The context is their initial impressions after playing the set during the pre-release weekend (Sealed format) and some early practice drafts, prior to the set's digital release. They discuss shifting card evaluations, mechanic assessments, potential archetype strength, and overall format feel.  

## Mechanic Assessments  

### Collect Evidence - Generally Easy Upside  
**Timestamp:** [00:09:15]  
**Take:** Collect Evidence feels relatively easy to enable and often acts as flexible upside on cards, similar to Bargain, rather than a difficult hoop to jump through. Dedicated "Collect Evidence" build-around archetypes might be harder to assemble effectively.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "it has felt fairly easy to enable and I think is mostly just upside on a card like flexible upside rather than a hoop to jump through" [Ethan]  
- "I'm a little more skeptical of [collect evidence archetypes]... felt a little tough to like make that come together" [Ethan]  
- "I think it's been fairly fairly doable [enabling collect evidence]" [Ethan]  
**Confidence Level:** High (Ethan), Medium (Ben - agrees conceptually but lacks gameplay data)  

### Disguise - Well-Designed, Efficiency Matters  
**Timestamp:** [00:16:10] & [00:17:40] & [00:20:20]  
**Take:** The Disguise mechanic seems well-designed. However, for common disguise creatures to be effective, they generally need to flip up for two mana (with Faerie Snoop being a potential exception). Paying high mana costs (5+) to flip creatures feels like a losing strategy reminiscent of Khans of Tarkir, which seems too slow for MKM's expected pace. Killing disguise creatures before they flip is often correct.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "Disguise has seemed really well designed to me so far" [Ethan]  
- "if they flip up for more than two Mana with the exception of fairy Snoop at common like I am just completely uninterested" [Ethan]  
- "it needs to be disguising towards Mana efficiency" [Ethan]  
- "I feel pretty strongly that that [spending 5/6 mana to flip] is going to be a losing recipe in murders of Carlo Manor" [Ethan]  
- "if I had the chance to kill a disguise creature before my opponent flipped it up like I wanted to do it they were almost all good" [Ben]  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Suspect - Great, Flexible, Skill-Testing  
**Timestamp:** [00:26:20] & [00:45:50]  
**Take:** Suspect felt like a great and cool mechanic in practice. It's flexible and adds meaningful decisions, punishing players who suspect creatures inappropriately if the game state shifts and they need blockers. Requires careful thought during combat and before assigning suspect.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "that felt great was a really cool mechanic I liked the gameplay of it it just was as flexible as we thought it was going to be" [Ben]  
- "it mattered when your opponent suspected a creature and then fell behind they got punished for choosing to suspect a creature" [Ben]  
- "suspect is a tricky mechanic like you need to think really hard before you suspect one of your creatures because if the tempo of the game turns around like it is disastrous" [Ben]  
**Confidence Level:** High  

## Archetype Predictions  

### White-Based Aggro (UW Detectives / RW Dog Walkers) - Early Menace  
**Timestamp:** [00:25:05]  
**Take:** White-based beatdown decks, particularly Blue-White Detectives (likened to MoM Knights) and Red-White aggro (featuring Dog Walker), look like the decks to beat early in the format and potentially format menaces.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I think the early decks to draft and try to win with are going to be the white Beatdown decks especially blue whitedetectives that deck just looks like it's going to be a complete Menace In The Format" [Ben]  
- "I just want to draft red white dog walkers that's all I want to do" [Ethan]  
- "certainly red white I think is going to be able to beat down as well" [Ben]  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Black's Role - Likely Controlling, Aggro Concerns  
**Timestamp:** [00:44:10]  
**Take:** Black seems to lack strong aggressive common creatures, potentially making it difficult for Black-based aggressive decks (like Rakdos Suspect) to thrive, similar to its role in LCI. However, Black appears excellent in controlling roles, pairing well with Blue, Green, and potentially in a Black-White utility/attrition shell.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "wondering if black is going to be again in a spot similar to where it was in LCI where it's just very hard for it to be aggressive... makes me worried for black red" [Ben]  
- "I also do think black is incredible at playing a controlling role certainly excellent paired with blue high hopes for the black white utility thing and then I think black Green's also going to have some legs" [Ben]  
- "Black going to get good creatures at common I don't know but it really doesn't have any which is kind of a problem" [Ethan]  
**Confidence Level:** Medium (Speculative based on commons and early feel)  

### Black-White Small Creatures - Assertive Potential  
**Timestamp:** [00:43:40]  
**Take:** Black-White might have an assertive angle focusing on cheap creatures that generate value (Novice Inspector, Unscrupulous Agent) combined with "power two or less matters" synergies and cards like Toxin Analysis.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I do think it plays nicely in the black white I think that black white like small creatures that can be an assertive space..." [Ethan]  
- "...you're playing your novice inspector on one you play your unscrupulous St on two like sure those cards like they're two for ones... I think that black white deck makes use of them with whatever the go wide stuff the the power two or less matters stuff and toxin analysis..." [Ethan]  
**Confidence Level:** Medium  

### Green-Based Decks - Tools for Late Game  
**Timestamp:** [00:14:45] & [00:25:30]  
**Take:** Colors with late-game mechanics (like Green with Collect Evidence) also seem to have good early/mid-game tools to survive, which should help those strategies succeed. Green (along with Black) seems to have the tools to combat the fast White aggro decks.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...the colors that have the late game mechanics in murders of Carlo Manor also just have good classic tools to help you get to the late game I think which is going to be a huge Boon for them..." [Ben]  
- "I think black and green get the tools to try to stop that [White aggro]." [Ben]  
**Confidence Level:** Medium  

## Card Evaluations  

### Shock vs Galvanize - Shock is Better (Hot Take)  
**Timestamp:** [00:11:05] & [00:45:15]  
**Take:** Ethan's hot take is that Shock (R, deal 2) is better than Galvanize (1R, deal 3/5). Reasoning is that creatures are generally small, and Shock's one-mana efficiency, especially against disguise creatures (trading mana evenly), is premium. Pick order suggested: Shock 1 > Galvanize 1 > Shock 2 > Shock 3. Ben is close to agreeing but needs more data.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I think shock is better than Galvanize" [Ethan]  
- "everything is very small in this set the creatures are small... shock being so efficient slash Mana neutral like mut trading even on Mana with disguise creatures I'm going my my my pick word in my head is I want shock one then I want Galvanize one and then I think I want shock two shock three" [Ethan]  
- "I don't know that I'm ready to cosign it yet but I'm close" [Ben]  
**Confidence Level:** High (Ethan's conviction), Medium (Overall agreement)  

### Common Hybrid Disguise Creatures (Dog Walker, Gadget Tech, Faerie Snoop, Sanguin Savior, Granite Witness) - Excellent
**Timestamp:** [00:16:15] & [00:17:00]  
**Take:** The cycle of common hybrid disguise creatures (Dog Walker RW, Gadget Technician UR, Faerie Snoop UB, Sanguin Savior WB) plus the Blue-White Granite Witness are all excellent and flexible, playing out as expected. Their concentration in White and Blue significantly boosts those colors.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...nailed the big four common hybrid morphs... think those are all excellent cards..." [Ethan]  
- "I would also add [Granite Witness] to this list... blue white one that's a 3-2 flyer with vigilance which is also just huge... felt very versatile..." [Ben]  
- "...all five of these good ones if we're adding Granite witness to the list are white and blue..." [Ethan]  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Green Common Disguise Creatures - Clunky and Bad  
**Timestamp:** [00:18:55]  
**Take:** In contrast to the allied color pairs, the common Green hybrid disguise creatures are evaluated as "clunk city," "really clunky and bad." This undermines Green's supposed role as a primary disguise color.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...the four green ones are all just clunk city right and I I know I I know we hate green on this podcast... but like they're all really clunky and bad" [Ethan]  
- "They are all really clunky and bad..." [Ben]  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Vitu-Ghazi Inspector - Quite Good  
**Timestamp:** [00:13:55] & [00:15:05] & [00:46:50]  
**Take:** The 1G 1/3 reach creature is quite good, even without collecting evidence. The 1/3 reach body lines up well against expected threats. The ability to put the +1/+1 counter anywhere (not just itself) upon collecting evidence makes it even better. Ranked as potentially Green's #2 common.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...the two Mana 13 reach in green... I think is quite good..." [Ethan]  
- "...it can put the counter anywhere ooh I didn't know that either yeah so that I think just bumps it up even more..." [Ethan]  
- "I like V2 gazi inspector in the number two spot [for Green commons]" [Ethan]  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Reasonable Doubt - Potential, But Maybe Not Top Tier  
**Timestamp:** [00:15:20] & [00:15:50]  
**Take:** Reasonable Doubt (1U counter unless pay 2, suspect) has potential and might be better than initially thought, as players seem to be tapping out more than anticipated. However, Ben remains cautious, noting that on key turns like turn 4, opponents might play and flip a disguise creature, making it just a trade with a two-drop. Playable, but maybe not a top common.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I'm I'm I got my eyes on Reasonable Doubt" [Ethan]  
- "I agree it's got potential but I'm not willing to like go all in on this is one of the top blue Commons yet..." [Ben]  
- "...want to have play to disguise creature flip up that disguise creature for two Mana double spell maybe and then you're just trading with a two drop" [Ben]  
**Confidence Level:** Medium (Split opinion/uncertainty)  

### Makeshift Binding - Incredible  
**Timestamp:** [00:23:30]  
**Take:** The white Oblivion Ring variant (2W, exile creature, gain 2 life when it leaves) is incredible.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "makeshift binding... the card is incredible" [Ben]  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Dramatic Accusation - Clunky (Ben) vs Fine (Ethan)  
**Timestamp:** [00:23:40] & [00:24:10]  
**Take:** Disagreement on the blue Pacifism aura (2U, tap, keep tapped, UU shuffle). Ethan found it fine and effective in Sealed for dealing with bombs. Ben thinks it's very clunky, especially compared to Makeshift Binding, lacking the life gain buffer.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I found the blue aura to be fine... found that to be pretty effective" [Ethan]  
- "...that card is clunky with the capital c okay all right that's fair fair and there's no lifegain..." [Ben]  
**Confidence Level:** Low (Disagreement)  

### Inside Source - Very Good, Potential Best White Common  
**Timestamp:** [00:27:10]  
**Take:** The 2W 1/1 that makes a 2/2 Detective token is very good, putting significant stats on board. Potentially White's best common, rivaling Novice Inspector.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...three Mana for 2 two plus one one I have liked" [Ethan]  
- "...card's been very good... could see that maybe being White's best common..." [Ben]  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Forensic Researcher - Good/Playable, Better Than Expected  
**Timestamp:** [00:27:45]  
**Take:** The 2U 1/3 that untaps or taps (with collect evidence) is good and more playable than initially thought. It provides ramp early and becomes removal/tempo later, synergizing well with collect evidence strategies and enabling disguise flips.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...card's good fine I mean not like a super high pick or anything but certainly more playable than I would have thought..." [Ben]  
- "...this is how kind of freeish collect evidence is... play on three used it as a manad dor for a couple turns and then it was a Tapper..." [Ethan]  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Extract a Confession - Good But Awkward, Limit Copies  
**Timestamp:** [00:28:50]  
**Take:** The 1B edict (collect evidence 6 for "greatest power") is very good but can be awkward against tokens or boards of small creatures. You don't want too many copies because reliably collecting evidence 6 is key, and multiple copies make that harder. Happy with one copy.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...very good but also can be super super awkward... there are tokens early... things are small..." [Ethan]  
- "...don't think you can pick it that highly... pretty happy with one copy..." [Ethan]  
- "...you want to be able to collect evidence six and to do that reliably you can't run that many copies of this card" [Ben]  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Gearbane Orangutan - Big Miss, Secret Gold Card  
**Timestamp:** [00:29:40]  
**Take:** Revising a previous positive take, Ethan is now "out" on the 2R 2/2 reach that potentially grows by destroying/sacking an artifact. It feels like a secret gold card needing specific synergies (like Clues) and isn't reliable.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I'm out on this a big Miss... definitely a secret gold card... pretty off this card" [Ethan]  
**Confidence Level:** High (Ethan's revised take)  

### Goblin Maskmaker - Polarizing (Ben High, Ethan Low)  
**Timestamp:** [00:30:05] & [00:30:10]  
**Take:** Significant disagreement. Ethan is off the card. Ben is "jazzed," seeing it as a key enabler for a "Plan B archetype." He argues it attacks well early due to a lack of 2/2s and ramping out disguise creatures is powerful.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I am also off this card" [Ethan]  
- "...you seem to be pretty jazzed... not a lot of two Manatutos that just blank this... getting to ramp your disguise creatures out playing your 2 two Ward on two I do think is a big game... Plan B archetype that I'm really got my eye on..." [Ben]  
**Confidence Level:** Low (Strong disagreement)  

### Reckless Detective - Busted, Very Strong  
**Timestamp:** [00:31:10]  
**Take:** The 1R 0/3 uncommon that rummages on attack (potentially becoming a 2/3) is considered "busted" and "really really strong," requiring no specific synergies to be great.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...this card is just busted... you don't need any synergies... two Mana two3 looter for free... really really strong" [Ethan]  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Nervous Gardener - Very Impressive, Gets Surveil Lands  
**Timestamp:** [00:31:45] & [00:46:50]  
**Take:** The 1G 2/2 disguise creature that finds a basic land type on flip is very impressive. Crucially, it can find Surveil lands (which have basic land types), making it better than a simple Civic Wayfinder effect. Ranked as Green's potential #1 common.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...gets cards with Basic Land types so you can get your surveil lands with gardener yeah card's been very impressive" [Ben]  
- "I think [Nervous Gardener] is still clearly number one [Green common]" [Ethan]  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Flourishing Bloomkin - Very Strong  
**Timestamp:** [00:32:15]  
**Take:** The 1G 0/0 disguise creature (gets +1/+1 per Forest, flips for 4G to find two Forests) is very good, even outside of dedicated monogreen decks. In a typical two-color green deck, it flips as a relevant body that ramps and provides card advantage.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...it's just very good... you also don't need to [be monogreen]... this is just like GNA flip up as a two two or a three three that draws you two cards and ramps you this card is really really strong" [Ethan]  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Push // Pull - Surprisingly Good (Pull Side)  
**Timestamp:** [00:33:00]  
**Take:** The Orzhov/Rakdos split card is surprisingly good, mainly because the Pull side (reanimate two creatures with haste, sac at end step) comes up more often and is more impactful than initially expected, especially with ETB effects. Rated around B-/C+, worse than premium commons like Shock.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...surprised at how often you want to cast pull and I have cast pull multiple times so far with like ETB effects... pretty big swing... pretty pretty darn good." [Ethan]  
- "probably worse than shock okay i' probably i' give it like a C+ I think okay C C+ on like flexibility and so maybe maybe B minus..." [Ethan]  
**Confidence Level:** Medium (Based on early surprising results)  

### Warleader's Call - Broken, Best Rare Contender  
**Timestamp:** [00:34:05]  
**Take:** The 1RW enchantment (Anthem + creature ETB pings opponent) is considered "broken" and potentially one of the best rares in the set.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "have not seen it this card's broken I like this is going to be one of the best rares in the set" [Ben]  
**Confidence Level:** High (Strong conviction despite not seeing it)  

### Do Diligence - Niche Aggro Card, High Ceiling  
**Timestamp:** [00:34:40] & [00:36:10]  
**Take:** The 2W aura (ench creature gets +2/+2 vigilance, another creature gets temporary +2/+2 vigilance) isn't a high pick but has a high ceiling in dedicated white aggro decks, forcing awkward blocks. Vulnerable to efficient removal like Shock. Seen as a potential 22nd/23rd card in specific decks.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...don't think it's a super high pick or anything but in in the white Decks that want to push damage has a pretty high ceiling... pretty impressed..." [Ben]  
- "...issue is there there's great efficient removal like imagine trying to land against shock..." [Ethan]  
- "...could be a niche 22nd 23rd card..." [Ben]  
**Confidence Level:** Medium  

### Bubble Smuggler - Bad/Clunky  
**Timestamp:** [00:36:25]  
**Take:** The 1U 2/1 disguise creature that flips for 5U into a 6/5 is bad. The front side is atrocious, forcing you to play it disguised, and the six-mana flip cost is prohibitively expensive and inefficient for the format. Compared negatively to playing Khans of Tarkir.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...not good in the format I don't think like because a one and a blue two one is atrocious... almost always a you have to play it as a disguise creature and then pay six to flip it up... playing cons of tarir and I I don't think you want to play cons of tarir... I'm pretty off bubble Smuggler" [Ethan]  
- "you kind of sold me on clunky" [Ben]  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Crimestoppers' Sprite - Very Good, Potential Best Blue Common  
**Timestamp:** [00:37:25]  
**Take:** The 2U 2/2 flying Faerie Detective that taps (or stuns with CE 6) is very good in this format's context, potentially Blue's best common. Better than a simple Frost Lynx comparison might suggest.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...this card is very good... this card is great in the context of this format I think" [Ben]  
- "is this the best blue common yeah I think so" [Ethan]  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Toxin Analysis - Quite Good, Especially Aggro/Suspect
**Timestamp:** [00:37:55]  
**Take:** The B instant (Deathtouch, Lifelink, Investigate) is quite good, though not top common level. It shines with Suspect creatures (potential 3-for-1) and in aggressive decks where it forces blocks and generates value.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...great with suspect... obvious thing... three for one... also think it's just good in aggressive decks... I do think it's quite good" [Ethan]  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Case of the Gateway Express - Incredible/Broken (Speculative)  
**Timestamp:** [00:38:55]  
**Take:** The 1W Case (ETB creatures deal damage to target creature, Solved: +1/+0 anthem) seems incredible and potentially broken based on playing the format, even without seeing it on the battlefield yet. Synergizes with deathtouch (e.g., Toxin Analysis).  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...this card has to be incredible like it just has to be broken" [Ben]  
- "I agree that it has to be broken also because of the way it's worded it pairs pretty nicely with toxin analysis..." [Ethan]  
**Confidence Level:** High (Strong conviction based on theory/format feel)  

### Agency Outfitter - Not Good  
**Timestamp:** [00:39:25]  
**Take:** The 4UU 4/3 Sphinx that tutors equipment (Magnifying Glass/Thinking Cap) is not good. It's too expensive, requires playing mediocre equipment, and the pieces don't fit a cohesive strategy (control body wants aggro/midrange equipment).  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...also not good just too expensive... weird combinations of effects that don't really fit in a cohesive archetype..." [Ben]  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Out Cold - Backbreaking/Oppressive (Hot Take)  
**Timestamp:** [00:40:30]  
**Take:** Ben's hot take: The 3W instant (tap two, stun two, investigate) is "crazy impressed," "horrifically oppressive," and "backbreaking" if you have any board presence. Buys significant time and replaces itself. Potential #1 White common contender.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I have been crazy impressed with out cold... horrifically oppressive... this card is backbreaking if you have any sort of board presents to back it up" [Ben]  
**Confidence Level:** High (Ben's conviction)  

### Cold Case Cracker - Fine/Mediocre  
**Timestamp:** [00:41:15]  
**Take:** The 3U 3/3 flyer that investigates on death is just "fine," not actively good or bad. Awkward because you don't want it to die if attacking, and the opponent often dictates when you get the clue.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...fine yeah it's a fine card like it's not bad but it's also not good... don't want your three3 flyer to die... easy for my opponent to dictate when it died..." [Ethan]  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Deduce - Filler, Raw Draw Isn't Needed  
**Timestamp:** [00:42:10]  
**Take:** Revising a previous positive take, Ethan now views Deduce (1U draw, investigate) as "pretty filler." The format seems to provide enough value through creatures/effects that affect the board, making spending mana on raw card draw less desirable and potentially too slow.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...pretty filler... don't know if you had there's time for that... just don't want raw cards like there's so much value among cards anyway..." [Ethan]  
**Confidence Level:** High (Ethan's revised take)  

### Unscrupulous Agent - Moved Up, Great in Draft/Sealed  
**Timestamp:** [00:43:00]  
**Take:** The 1B 1/1 discard creature (also a Detective) has moved up the pick order. It felt amazing in Sealed and is expected to be great in Draft too. The Detective type is surprisingly relevant.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...moved unscrupulous agent up the pick order... detective... more relevant than you would think" [Ethan]  
- "...felt amazing in Seal... imagine this card has to be great in draft as well" [Ben]  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Person of Interest - Very Good (Revised Up)  
**Timestamp:** [00:45:25]  
**Take:** The 3R 2/2 that suspects itself and makes a 2/2 Detective token was previously underrated and is actually very good. A 2/2 Menace plus a 2/2 body is strong.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...Person of Interest was off my list last week and that was an egregious error... it's a 2 two Menace plus a 2 two... so good" [Ethan]  
**Confidence Level:** High (Revised take)  

### Bite Down on Crime - Good, Green #3 Common  
**Timestamp:** [00:46:50]  
**Take:** The Green fight spell (potentially costs 1G with CE 6) is good, likely Green's #3 common behind Nervous Gardener and Vitu-Ghazi Inspector, especially viewing Collect Evidence as achievable upside. Its potential efficiency makes it better than the Loxodon Eavesdropper.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...bite down on crime number three is good... the fact that bite down on crime can cost two Mana I think puts that at number three for me..." [Ethan]  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Escape Tunnel / Public Thoroughfare - Excellent Fixing  
**Timestamp:** [00:22:05] & [00:51:20]  
**Take:** The common fixing lands (Escape Tunnel, Public Thoroughfare) are excellent and highly desirable. They enable splashes, particularly for off-color disguise creatures, and Escape Tunnel's unblockable ability adds significant utility, especially for pushing damage with disguised or small creatures.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...opens up so much for you... very impressed with those two cards and really wanted them in sealed..." [Ben]  
- "...Escape tunnel being excellent as a fixer enabling splashes... also the the last ability... really you got to be careful about letting your life total get too low..." [Ben]  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Clue Lands (Artifact Lands) - Potentially Terrible Due to Artifact Type  
**Timestamp:** [00:22:40]  
**Take:** The common dual lands that enter tapped and are also artifacts might be terrible. Being an artifact is seen as a significant downside due to incidental artifact removal potentially leading to being "Stone Rained."  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...afterwards he was like I think this card might be terrible... if you have any way to interact with artifacts in your deck you're just going to Stone rign me... I think artifact on that card is a downside" [Ethan]  
**Confidence Level:** Medium (Based on one anecdote and theory)  

## Color Pair / General Format Analysis  

### Format Power Level & Feel - Powerful, MoM-esque  
**Timestamp:** [00:05:30] & [00:24:45]  
**Take:** The format feels powerful, similar to March of the Machine (MoM), with strong threats and strong interaction leading to potentially clean, interactive gameplay. High hopes for the format overall.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...format playing with it just felt really powerful in a good way like felt March of the machine s to me..." [Ben]  
- "...leads me back to the format feeling like March of the machine esque right we had great interaction great threats there..." [Ben]  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Format Speed & Efficiency - Efficiency is King  
**Timestamp:** [00:11:50] & [00:42:40]  
**Take:** Efficiency seems paramount. Creatures are generally small, making cheap interaction like Shock very valuable. Getting good rates on cards matters a lot, likely more so than in lower-power formats. Raw card draw might be too slow.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...everything is very small in this set the creatures are small... shock being so efficient..." [Ethan]  
- "...efficiency is King like you really want great rates on the cards that you're playing... rate matters a ton..." [Ethan]  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Early Game - Disputed (Starts Turn 2 vs Turn 3)  
**Timestamp:** [00:12:40] & [00:13:00]  
**Take:** Disagreement on the early turns. Ethan feels there isn't much impactful stuff before turn 3, emphasizing the quality gap between premium and filler two-drops. Ben feels there are plenty of good twos and games don't necessarily wait until turn 3 to start developing meaningfully.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...not a lot of great stuff to do before turn three..." [Ethan]  
- "I don't know that I agree I feel like there's a lot of good twos running around... didn't feel that the games were starting on turn three..." [Ben]  
**Confidence Level:** Low (Disagreement)  

### Land Count - 18 Lands Recommended  
**Timestamp:** [00:20:50] & [00:21:30]  
**Take:** The format feels mana-hungry due to Clues and Disguise costs. Playing 18 lands felt correct in Sealed and seems viable/good in Draft, especially with fixing available.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I played 18 lands and like maybe would have run 19... wanted Mana I was super Mana hungry..." [Ben]  
- "...doing a mix in draft... go 18 lands and I don't feel bad about running at lands..." [Ethan]  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Color Power Ranking (Preliminary) - White/Red Top, Green/Black Bottom?  
**Timestamp:** [00:18:35] & [00:49:40]  
**Take:** White and Red feel like the strongest colors initially, with White potentially #1 and Blue #2. Black and Green seem weaker, potentially duking it out for the bottom spots, though all colors seem playable. The concentration of good hybrid commons boosts White and Blue significantly.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...White's really white and red for me have like the those are my focus spots right now I think those colors are great..." [Ben]  
- "I would go white one blue two red three and then black and green duking it out somewhere okay but also think everything seems playable" [Ben responding to Ethan]  
- "...all five of these good ones [hybrid commons]... are white and blue... certainly going to juice blue and white a little bit..." [Ethan/Ben]  
**Confidence Level:** Medium (Explicitly preliminary)  

### Play Boosters - Feel Different, Less Wheel Impact
**Timestamp:** [00:05:30] & [00:53:40]  
**Take:** Play boosters felt slightly different when opening (fewer cards, art cards less enjoyed by Ben). Ethan didn't notice much difference in rarity spread. A key difference noted for draft is that the "wheel" will have fewer cards (5 remaining), likely making wheeling specific cards less common or impactful. Prize packs being draftable again is a positive.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "...it did feel a little different but in a bad way..." [Ben on opening]  
- "no I like truly like the only reason I like noticed a difference is because like we've been thinking about it for so long..." [Ethan on opening/rarity]  
- "...when you get to the wheel there's five cards left in the pack which is kind of wild right like I think the wheel is going to matter less..." [Ethan]  
**Confidence Level:** Medium (Based on initial feel and pack structure)
