Okay, here is the comparative analysis of the initial takes versus the retrospective reality for the Magic: The Gathering set *Murders at Karlov Manor* (MKM), based on the provided Lords of Limited content.

## Overview of Analysis: Murders at Karlov Manor (MKM)

This analysis compares early predictions and hot takes on the MKM Limited format from the Lords of Limited podcast (recorded during pre-release/early access) against their later retrospective "50 Takes" episode after extensive play, including the Pro Tour.

**General Patterns:**
*   The initial assessment of the format's core dynamics, particularly the impact of Disguise (and Ward 2), the importance of efficiency, and the strength of White, was remarkably accurate.
*   Evaluations of specific mechanics (Disguise, Collect Evidence, Suspect) held up very well.
*   Predictions about top commons and the general power level of certain colors/archetypes were often directionally correct, though specific rankings evolved.
*   There were some notable misses, particularly around cards that required specific synergies or whose power level was context-dependent (e.g., Gearbane Orangutan, Connecting the Dots, Goblin Maskmaker disagreement).
*   The impact of Play Boosters (less wheeling) was correctly anticipated.

**Most Notable Hits:**
*   Identifying White-based aggro as a top strategy early on.
*   Correctly assessing the massive impact of Ward 2 on removal evaluation and format texture.
*   Ethan's hot take that Shock > Galvanize proved entirely correct.
*   Recognizing the quality of the common hybrid disguise creatures (especially Dog Walker).
*   Predicting the importance of efficiency and the format feeling powerful/interactive.

**Most Notable Misses/Adjustments:**
*   Initial overestimation of some cards requiring synergy (Gearbane Orangutan, potentially Connecting the Dots).
*   Underestimation of the raw power/oppressiveness of certain cards like Out Cold initially.
*   Disagreements on cards like Goblin Maskmaker highlight areas where initial reads diverged significantly.
*   Underestimation of Blue-Green's eventual strength (though Green's tools were noted).
*   Initial positive take on Deduce was walked back significantly.

## Mechanic Assessments

### Disguise (and Ward 2)
**Initial Take:** Disguise seemed well-designed. Flipping up for 2 mana was key for commons. High flip costs felt too slow. Killing disguise creatures pre-flip seemed correct. Ward 2 wasn't explicitly highlighted as the *reason* in these quotes, but the focus on efficiency implies its impact.
**Retrospective Reality:** Ward 2 was identified as a game-changing element, fundamentally altering removal evaluation and enabling the 3-mana 2/2 format. It protected early plays and made expensive removal much worse. The importance of efficient flips was confirmed.
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly accurate. The core gameplay implications of disguise (efficiency matters, kill early if possible) were understood. The retrospective added the crucial layer of *why* (Ward 2's specific impact).
**Key Factors:** Understanding the tempo implications of morph-like mechanics, combined with observing the mana costs in the set. The retrospective fully grasped Ward 2's specific role.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "if they flip up for more than two Mana... I am just completely uninterested... it needs to be disguising towards Mana efficiency."
- Retrospective: "War[d] 2 changed the game like cuz you couldn't just fire off shock for like infinite value and get ahead."
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

### Collect Evidence
**Initial Take:** Felt relatively easy to enable, often just flexible upside rather than a major hoop. Dedicated build-arounds seemed potentially tough.
**Retrospective Reality:** Confirmed as a successful, viable, and engaging late-game mechanic. It rewarded graveyard synergies (especially UG/BG) without feeling clunky. Enabling it was generally achievable.
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly accurate. The initial assessment correctly identified it as achievable upside rather than a prohibitive cost in most cases, and that dedicated decks required specific pieces.
**Key Factors:** Comparing it to similar mechanics (like Bargain) and observing the density of enablers (self-mill, cheap creatures).
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "it has felt fairly easy to enable and I think is mostly just upside on a card like flexible upside rather than a hoop to jump through"
- Retrospective: "collecting evidence was a win for late game mechanics everywhere... this was great and it was cool and competitive and like just hard enough to draft that you couldn't like do it all the time"
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

### Suspect
**Initial Take:** Felt great, cool, flexible, and skill-testing. Punished incorrect usage if the board state changed.
**Retrospective Reality:** Played out beautifully, adding tactical depth without dominating. Seen as a clean, well-designed minor mechanic.
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly accurate. The initial positive impression and assessment of its tactical nature were spot on.
**Key Factors:** Direct gameplay experience during pre-release confirmed the mechanic's interesting decision points.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "that felt great was a really cool mechanic I liked the gameplay of it it just was as flexible as we thought it was going to be"
- Retrospective: "suspect played out beautifully on offense and defense but was ultimately a fairly small part of the format which I think is fine... I really liked I really liked suspect it was just very clean"
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

## Archetype Predictions

### White-Based Aggro (UW Detectives / RW Dog Walkers)
**Initial Take:** Predicted to be the early decks to beat, potential format menaces. Likened UW Detectives to MoM Knights. RW Dog Walkers also highlighted.
**Retrospective Reality:** RW emerged as the #1 archetype. UW was #3. White was the best color, powering aggressive strategies. The core prediction was absolutely correct.
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly accurate. Identified the key aggressive strategies and the dominance of White early on.
**Key Factors:** Recognizing the density of strong, aggressive white commons (Novice Inspector, Inside Source) and powerful uncommons (Dog Walker, On the Job).
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "I think the early decks to draft and try to win with are going to be the white Beatdown decks especially blue whitedetectives that deck just looks like it's going to be a complete Menace In The Format"
- Retrospective: Archetype Ranking places RW #1, UW #3. Take 4 identifies MKM as a "White or Green format". Take 44 notes White's incredible common depth.
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

### Black's Role (Controlling > Aggro)
**Initial Take:** Worried about Black's ability to be aggressive due to weak common creatures (similar to LCI). Predicted it would excel in controlling roles (UB, GB, potentially WB utility).
**Retrospective Reality:** Black was ranked the weakest color (#5). Its best performing archetypes were generally more controlling or synergistic (GB #6, BW #7, UB #10). Rakdos (RB) Suspect aggro was ranked #9. The prediction held true.
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly accurate. The assessment of Black's strengths (control, synergy) and weaknesses (aggro) based on its common pool was correct.
**Key Factors:** Analyzing the common creature base and comparing it to previous formats (LCI).
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "wondering if black is going to be again in a spot similar to where it was in LCI where it's just very hard for it to be aggressive... makes me worried for black red... I also do think black is incredible at playing a controlling role"
- Retrospective: Color Ranking places Black last. Archetype rankings show UB and RB near the bottom, with GB and BW performing better, fitting the controlling/synergy prediction.
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

### Green-Based Decks (Late Game Tools)
**Initial Take:** Noted Green had late-game mechanics (Collect Evidence) but also seemed to have the tools to survive early, potentially combating White aggro.
**Retrospective Reality:** Green was ranked the #2 color. UG was the #2 archetype, GB was #6. Green provided strong late-game value and synergy (Collect Evidence, Roots/Outline) and had key defensive commons (Nervous Gardener, eventually Locksley Eavesdropper).
**Accuracy Analysis:** Partially Accurate. Correctly identified Green's late-game potential and survival tools. Didn't explicitly predict the dominance of UG, but laid the groundwork for Green's success.
**Key Factors:** Recognizing the synergy between mechanics (Collect Evidence) and card quality (good blockers/value creatures).
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "...the colors that have the late game mechanics in murders of Carlo Manor also just have good classic tools to help you get to the late game..."
- Retrospective: Green ranked #2 color. UG ranked #2 archetype. Take 10 highlights Collect Evidence as a win. Take 20 notes Gardener/Eavesdropper as top commons.
**Verdict:** Partially Accurate

---

## Card Evaluations

### Shock vs Galvanize
**Initial Take:** Ethan's hot take: Shock > Galvanize due to efficiency against small creatures and disguise (mana neutrality). Pick order: Shock 1 > Galvanize 1 > Shock 2.
**Retrospective Reality:** Shock confirmed as top Red common. Galvanize deemed "pretty average" because killing a disguise creature effectively cost 4 mana (1R + 2 Ward). Efficiency was paramount.
**Accuracy Analysis:** Ethan's prediction and reasoning were spot on. The impact of Ward 2 made this evaluation entirely correct.
**Key Factors:** Understanding the mana efficiency implications of Ward 2 and the prevalence of disguise targets.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "I think shock is better than Galvanize... shock being so efficient slash Mana neutral like mut trading even on Mana with disguise creatures..."
- Retrospective: "even something like Galvanize which should yes by all rights be a premium Magic the Gathering card was pretty average because it was four Mana to kill a disguise creature" (Take 7). Shock listed as top Red common (Take 20).
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

### Common Hybrid Disguise Creatures (Allied Colors + UW)
**Initial Take:** The cycle (Dog Walker, Gadget Tech, Faerie Snoop, Sanguin Savior) plus Granite Witness were all deemed excellent and flexible, boosting White and Blue.
**Retrospective Reality:** These were generally good, flexible role-players, but mostly landed as "filler" or "solid playable" rather than auto-picks, *except* for Dog Walker which was premium. They were seen as balanced overall.
**Accuracy Analysis:** Partially Accurate. Correctly identified their flexibility and general playability. Overestimated their average power level slightly (calling them all "excellent"), though Dog Walker lived up to the hype. The boost to White/Blue was real.
**Key Factors:** Flexibility is valuable, but raw power level still matters. Dog Walker's stats/ability stood out.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "...nailed the big four common hybrid morphs... think those are all excellent cards..."
- Retrospective: "the hybrid disguise creatures... were balanced... didn't we we went in thinking like oh wow these are all going to be such high picks because they're so flexible and they were not... that flexibility almost landed in a filler territory Beyond those those top premium ones like dog walker" (Take 21).
**Verdict:** Partially Accurate

### Green Common Disguise Creatures
**Initial Take:** Evaluated as "clunk city," "really clunky and bad," undermining Green's disguise role.
**Retrospective Reality:** This assessment largely held. Cards like Topiary Panther eventually found homes ("OG Buffalo") in synergy decks but weren't generally high picks. Nervous Gardener (a non-hybrid disguise) was excellent, but the *hybrid* green ones were indeed less impressive than the allied color ones.
**Accuracy Analysis:** Mostly Accurate. The initial negative assessment of the Green *hybrid* disguise commons was largely correct in terms of general pick order, though some found niche roles.
**Key Factors:** High flip costs and less immediately impactful abilities compared to the allied color cycle.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "...the four green ones are all just clunk city right... they're all really clunky and bad"
- Retrospective: While not explicitly revisited as a cycle, the lack of mention as top performers and discussion of cards like Topiary Panther as needing the "every piece of the buffalo" evaluation (Take 33) supports the initial "clunky" assessment.
**Verdict:** Mostly Accurate

### Vitu-Ghazi Inspector
**Initial Take:** Called "quite good," potentially Green's #2 common. 1/3 reach body good, counter placement flexibility noted as a plus.
**Retrospective Reality:** Not explicitly mentioned in the 50 Takes retrospective list of top commons or major over/underperformers. It likely settled into being a solid playable C+/B- level common, but not a top contender like Gardener or Eavesdropper.
**Accuracy Analysis:** Mostly Inaccurate. Overestimated its standing. While a decent card, it didn't reach the "quite good" or potential #2 common status predicted.
**Key Factors:** The format valued proactive plays and synergy more; a 1/3 reach body, while okay, wasn't premium. Other green commons offered more impact (Gardener - fixing/body, Eavesdropper - value).
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "...the two Mana 13 reach in green... I think is quite good... I like V2 gazi inspector in the number two spot [for Green commons]"
- Retrospective: Not mentioned in Top Commons (Take 20) or other significant reassessments.
**Verdict:** Mostly Inaccurate

### Makeshift Binding
**Initial Take:** Called "incredible."
**Retrospective Reality:** Confirmed as excellent premium removal, crucial for dealing with rares. Highlighted alongside Shock, Torch, Hard-Hitting Question.
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly accurate. Correctly identified as a top-tier removal spell.
**Key Factors:** Efficient exile effect with minor upside (lifegain) is historically strong, especially in a format with powerful threats.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "makeshift binding... the card is incredible"
- Retrospective: "premium removal was excellent because of the rares running around... efficiency there just being able to take out a lot of the threats was was awesome" (Take 17, implicitly includes Binding).
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

### Inside Source
**Initial Take:** Called "very good," potentially White's best common alongside Novice Inspector.
**Retrospective Reality:** While Novice Inspector was crowned the best White common (Take 20), Inside Source remained a very strong card contributing to White's depth (Take 44). Not the *best*, but still excellent.
**Accuracy Analysis:** Partially Accurate. Correctly identified as a top-tier white common, slightly overestimated its position relative to Novice Inspector.
**Key Factors:** Efficiently putting multiple bodies on board is strong, especially for go-wide synergies (On the Job). Novice Inspector's clue value proved slightly more impactful overall.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "...card's been very good... could see that maybe being White's best common..."
- Retrospective: Novice Inspector named #1 White common (Take 20). White's depth praised (Take 44), implying Inside Source was still great.
**Verdict:** Partially Accurate

### Extract a Confession
**Initial Take:** Very good but awkward, don't want too many copies due to CE 6 requirement. Happy with one.
**Retrospective Reality:** Named the best Black common (Take 20). Its efficiency as a cheap removal spell, even in base mode, was highly valued. The CE 6 upside was significant when achievable.
**Accuracy Analysis:** Partially Accurate. Correctly identified as good, but underestimated its overall quality and pick priority. The awkwardness was real, but its base mode was often good enough, making it Black's best common despite the downsides.
**Key Factors:** Cheap interaction is always valuable. Edict effects are context-dependent but often necessary. Black lacked other efficient common removal.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "...very good but also can be super super awkward... pretty happy with one copy..."
- Retrospective: Named #1 Black common (Take 20).
**Verdict:** Partially Accurate

### Gearbane Orangutan
**Initial Take:** Ethan revised *down* from a previous positive take, calling it a "big miss," a "secret gold card," needing specific synergies.
**Retrospective Reality:** Confirmed as having Reach (Take 45), but otherwise not highlighted as a major player. The initial revised take (that it was narrow/synergy-dependent) seems accurate.
**Accuracy Analysis:** The *revised* early take (that it was narrow/bad) was accurate. The initial *unseen* positive take was wrong.
**Key Factors:** Requiring an artifact to sacrifice or destroy made it inconsistent outside of specific builds (clue decks).
**Quotes:**
- Initial (Revised): "I'm out on this a big Miss... definitely a secret gold card... pretty off this card"
- Retrospective: Only mentioned for having Reach (Take 45). Its absence from positive mentions supports the revised negative assessment.
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate (for the revised early take)

### Nervous Gardener
**Initial Take:** Very impressive, potential #1 Green common. Crucially noted it gets Surveil lands.
**Retrospective Reality:** Confirmed as a top Green common, sharing the top spot depending on deck needs (early draft vs. synergy). Its fixing and body were excellent.
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly accurate. Correctly identified its power level and the key interaction with Surveil lands.
**Key Factors:** Efficient body combined with valuable fixing/ramp, especially the ability to fetch dual lands.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "...gets cards with Basic Land types so you can get your surveil lands with gardener yeah card's been very impressive... I think [Nervous Gardener] is still clearly number one [Green common]"
- Retrospective: Listed as top Green common (competing with Eavesdropper depending on context) (Take 20).
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

### Push // Pull
**Initial Take:** Surprisingly good, mainly due to the Pull side being more relevant/impactful than expected. Rated C+/B-.
**Retrospective Reality:** Hailed as "incredible," highly flexible, potentially underrated. Pull side confirmed as game-ending. One of the best uncommons.
**Accuracy Analysis:** Partially Accurate. Correctly identified it as better than it looked and the Pull side being strong. Significantly underestimated its overall power level and flexibility (calling it C+/B- vs. top uncommon).
**Key Factors:** Flexibility of hybrid mana, combined with two relevant modes (Push for early interaction, Pull for late-game swings).
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "...surprised at how often you want to cast pull... pretty pretty darn good... i' give it like a C+ I think okay C C+... maybe B minus..."
- Retrospective: "Push Pull is incredible... it deserves your respect because of how flexible it is as an early pick... pull ends so many games" (Take 34).
**Verdict:** Partially Accurate

### Out Cold
**Initial Take:** Ben's hot take: "crazy impressed," "horrifically oppressive," "backbreaking" with board presence. Potential #1 White common contender.
**Retrospective Reality:** Confirmed as excellent, especially in UG (#2 archetype). Seen as better than Lost in the Maze (Take 35). Praised alongside On the Job as a top 4-drop (Take 19). While not the #1 White common (Novice Inspector), it was a premium card.
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly Accurate. Ben correctly identified its oppressive potential and high power level early on.
**Key Factors:** Tapping multiple creatures *and* drawing a card (via Investigate) is a massive tempo swing in any board-based format.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "I have been crazy impressed with out cold... horrifically oppressive... this card is backbreaking if you have any sort of board presents..."
- Retrospective: "out cold was part of that too right like that was out Cold's best home was blue green" (Take 18). "good twos were hard to find and good fours were everywhere... the way that both of those cards [Out Cold, On the Job] fail is when you don't have enough twos" (Take 19). "at the end of the day out cold was better than lost in the Maze" (Take 35).
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

### Deduce
**Initial Take:** Ethan revised *down* from a previous positive take, calling it "pretty filler," arguing raw card draw wasn't needed/too slow.
**Retrospective Reality:** Not mentioned in the 50 Takes, suggesting it indeed settled as filler or low-priority playable. The format valued board impact and tempo highly.
**Accuracy Analysis:** The *revised* early take was accurate. The format didn't reward spending two mana early for just card draw without board impact.
**Key Factors:** Format speed and the availability of value attached to creatures/permanents made dedicated draw spells less appealing.
**Quotes:**
- Initial (Revised): "...pretty filler... don't know if you had there's time for that... just don't want raw cards like there's so much value among cards anyway..."
- Retrospective: Absence from discussion supports the "filler" assessment.
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate (for the revised early take)

### Escape Tunnel / Public Thoroughfare
**Initial Take:** Called excellent fixing, highly desirable, enabling splashes. Escape Tunnel's ability noted as significant utility.
**Retrospective Reality:** Escape Tunnel confirmed as good, crucial fixing, potentially top 10 common pick order worthy. Public Thoroughfare deemed "not so much" (bad).
**Accuracy Analysis:** Partially Accurate. Correct on Escape Tunnel's quality and importance. Incorrect on Public Thoroughfare, which proved too slow/costly.
**Key Factors:** Escape Tunnel's fixing + utility was premium in a format wanting splashes and flexibility. Public Thoroughfare's tempo loss (entering tapped, costing 1) was too high.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "...opens up so much for you... very impressed with those two cards [Tunnel & Thoroughfare]..."
- Retrospective: "Escape tunnel was good fixing public thoroughfare was not so much... [Tunnel] honestly probably should have been somewhere in our top 10 Common pick order" (Take 29).
**Verdict:** Partially Accurate

### Clue Lands (Artifact Lands)
**Initial Take:** Speculated they might be terrible due to being artifacts, vulnerable to incidental removal ("Stone Rain").
**Retrospective Reality:** Scene of the Crime (the artifact dual land) was deemed unplayable due to vulnerability (Take 30). The initial fear was justified.
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly Accurate. The theoretical downside proved to be a real and significant drawback in practice.
**Key Factors:** The risk of getting a land destroyed by cheap artifact removal was too high for the minor upside.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "...afterwards he was like I think this card might be terrible... if you have any way to interact with artifacts in your deck you're just going to Stone rign me..."
- Retrospective: "other than Escape tunnel the nonbasic lands were pretty bad... scene of the crime you can't pay me to put that card in a deck" (Take 30).
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

## Color Pair / General Format Analysis

### Format Power Level & Feel (MoM-esque)
**Initial Take:** Felt powerful like March of the Machine (MoM), with strong threats/interaction leading to clean gameplay. High hopes.
**Retrospective Reality:** Generally regarded as a very good, synergistic format. While maybe not an "all-timer," it was well-received and interactive. The MoM comparison seems reasonable in terms of power level and interactivity.
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly Accurate. The initial feel for the format's power level and interactive nature held up.
**Key Factors:** Presence of strong rares, efficient commons, and impactful mechanics (Disguise, Clues, Collect Evidence).
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "...format playing with it just felt really powerful in a good way like felt March of the machine s to me..."
- Retrospective: "murders at Carl Manor was not an all-timer but it was a darn good debut for play boosters... it was a really fun draft format" (Take 50). Format emphasized synergy or powerful rares (Take 3).
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

### Format Speed & Efficiency (Efficiency is King)
**Initial Take:** Efficiency seemed paramount due to small creatures. Getting good rates mattered more than raw card draw.
**Retrospective Reality:** This was absolutely true. Ward 2 emphasized mana efficiency in removal. Cheap plays (Novice Inspector) were premium. Good twos were scarce and crucial (Take 19). Expensive, inefficient plays were punished.
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly Accurate. Correctly identified a core principle of the format's gameplay.
**Key Factors:** Ward 2 costs, prevalence of disguise, importance of tempo, scarcity of good two-drops.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "...efficiency is King like you really want great rates on the cards that you're playing... rate matters a ton..."
- Retrospective: Removal evaluation shifted to efficiency (Take 7). Good twos scarce, good fours abundant (Take 19).
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

### Color Power Ranking (Preliminary vs. Final)
**Initial Take:** White/Red top, Blue #2/3, Black/Green bottom? White #1, Blue #2, Red #3, BG fighting for last. All playable.
**Retrospective Reality:** Final: 1. White, 2. Green, 3. Red/Blue (tied), 5. Black. All viable.
**Accuracy Analysis:** Partially Accurate. Correctly identified White as #1 and Black near the bottom. Underestimated Green significantly and slightly overestimated Red/Blue relative to Green initially. The "all playable" assessment held.
**Key Factors:** Green's synergistic power (UG, GB) proved stronger than initially apparent. Red/Blue were good but Green's late game was potent.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "I would go white one blue two red three and then black and green duking it out somewhere okay but also think everything seems playable"
- Retrospective: "in first we have white in second we have green in third red tied with blue in fourth and last but I think certainly not least is black" (Take 5).
**Verdict:** Partially Accurate

### Play Boosters (Less Wheel Impact)
**Initial Take:** Noted fewer cards per pack (14 vs 15) means the wheel has fewer cards (5 vs 8/9), likely reducing its impact.
**Retrospective Reality:** Confirmed: "The Wheel is Kind of Dead." Wheeling cards was significantly less common and more variable due to one fewer card per pack.
**Accuracy Analysis:** Highly Accurate. Correctly predicted the impact of the smaller pack size on wheeling strategies.
**Key Factors:** Simple math based on pack size changes.
**Quotes:**
- Initial: "...when you get to the wheel there's five cards left in the pack which is kind of wild right like I think the wheel is going to matter less..."
- Retrospective: "The Wheel is Kind of Dead... Wheeling cards is significantly less common and more variable due to one fewer card per pack" (Take 2).
**Verdict:** Highly Accurate

## Patterns and Insights

*   **Mechanic Mastery:** The core functions and implications of the set's main mechanics (Disguise/Ward 2, Collect Evidence, Suspect) were understood very well from the outset. The impact of Ward 2, in particular, was a key insight that held true.
*   **Color Strength Signals:** Initial impressions of White's strength (driven by commons) and Black's weaknesses (lack of aggressive commons) were accurate. Green's potential was noted but its eventual standing was underestimated.
*   **Efficiency Focus:** The prediction that efficiency would be paramount was spot-on and influenced many correct card evaluations (Shock > Galvanize, Deduce being filler).
*   **Synergy vs. Rate:** Some initial misses came from evaluating cards in a vacuum versus their synergistic potential (or lack thereof). Gearbane Orangutan looked okay on rate but failed without synergy. Push/Pull looked okay but its flexibility and synergy pushed it higher. Connecting the Dots was powerful *when* synergistic, but narrower than first thought.
*   **Context is Key:** Cards like Locksley Eavesdropper overperformed initial comparisons because the format context (3-mana 2/2s common, Clues valuable) made them better than historical analogues. Conversely, Undercity Eliminator/Cornered Crook underperformed FTK comparisons due to Ward 2.
*   **Common Power Accurately Gauged:** Many top commons (Novice Inspector, Shock, Nervous Gardener, Makeshift Binding) were identified early. The overall depth of White commons was also noted early and confirmed later.
*   **Play Booster Impact:** The structural change (fewer cards) leading to less wheeling was correctly anticipated.

## Conclusion

Overall, the initial takes on *Murders at Karlov Manor* by Lords of Limited demonstrated a strong understanding of the format's fundamental characteristics. Predictions regarding the impact of key mechanics like Disguise/Ward 2, the importance of mana efficiency, and the strength of White proved highly accurate. While specific card rankings and archetype hierarchies evolved with deep format experience (notably Green's rise and the exact power level of some synergistic or flexible cards like Push/Pull), the foundational analysis provided a very solid starting point. The biggest lessons seem to be fully appreciating the impact of format context (like Ward 2) on card evaluation and accurately gauging the consistency and power of synergy-dependent cards, which often requires more extensive play. The successful prediction of Play Booster impacts also highlights an understanding of structural format changes.
