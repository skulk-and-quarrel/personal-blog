Okay, here is the retrospective analysis of the *Modern Horizons 3* draft format based on the provided Lords of Limited transcript.  

## Modern Horizons 3 (MH3) Retrospective: 50 Takes Summary  

This analysis summarizes the key retrospective evaluations and lessons learned about the *Modern Horizons 3* draft format, as discussed by the Lords of Limited hosts after significant experience with the set.  

## Overall Format Characteristics  

### Format Nature - Synergy Driven  
**Timestamp:** [00:04:28]  
**Current Evaluation:** MH3 is fundamentally a synergy-driven format where evaluating cards in isolation is ineffective. Success hinges on building cohesive decks where cards work together. Relying solely on stats like game-in-hand win rate can be misleading.  
**Initial Expectations:** Implied that standard vacuum evaluation methods were less applicable than anticipated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "modern Horizon 3 is a Synergy driven format evaluating cards in a vacuum really didn't work here"  
- "I think this was a really hard set if you relied on game and hand win rate a lot for your pick orders"  
- "you just really have to make sure cards are in the right home like you have to set the cards up for Success if you're not actively working to do that you're just leaving so much equity on the table in this format"  
**Key Insights:** Draft success required identifying synergistic packages and ensuring cards fit the deck's plan, rather than just picking generically powerful cards.  

### Drafting Strategy - Finding an Open Lane  
**Timestamp:** [00:05:18]  
**Current Evaluation:** Finding an open archetype during the draft was crucial to acquire powerful synergistic pieces late. Pivoting effectively was a key skill.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly stated, but the emphasis suggests this became more apparent with experience.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "it was imperative that you found an open Lane during the draft to get powerful synergies late for an uncontested archetype"  
- "so much of what I think I'll remember about this format is pivoting or understanding how to Pivot or what the off-ramps were for pivoting"  
- "if you do truly find the open Lane I think you're going to get rewarded more often than not in this format"  
**Key Insights:** The format heavily rewarded reading signals and committing to an under-drafted archetype, leading to powerful, cohesive decks. Trainwrecks often resulted from failing to pivot correctly or forcing a contested archetype.  

### Format Feel - Ability to "Cook"  
**Timestamp:** [00:06:21]  
**Current Evaluation:** MH3 offered immense potential for creative deckbuilding ("cooking") due to numerous build-arounds, cross-archetype synergies, and hidden modes within archetypes.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not stated, but the enthusiasm suggests this was a discovered positive aspect.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "modern Horizon's 3 is a format where you can really cook and I feel this in my the deepest part of my bones that like there's just so much there for you"  
- "it's such a playground of like there's build arounds there's lots of like cross archetype synergies there's obviously like streamline synergies"  
- "you can do a lot of stuff in this format but you have to like know how to do that stuff in the format"  
**Key Insights:** The format rewarded deep knowledge and creativity, allowing for diverse and powerful decks beyond the obvious archetypes.  

### Goal When Cooking - Fundamentally Broken Plays  
**Timestamp:** [00:07:00]  
**Current Evaluation:** The goal of synergistic "cooking" was to achieve plays that felt overwhelmingly powerful or "broken," like cheating mana costs with Energy, ramping into huge Eldrazi quickly, or creating massive threats unexpectedly.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not stated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "your goal when cooking in modern Horizon 3 was to do things that feel fundamentally broken"  
- Examples cited: "tune The Narrative into an amped Raptor and then play a three or a four drop for free," "ramping writhing Crysis into a seven drop," "casting faithful Watchdog... into fangs of Colonia to turn it into an 88 vigilance"  
**Key Insights:** The best synergistic decks aimed for high-ceiling plays that could overwhelm opponents quickly, rather than just incremental advantage.  

### Removal vs. Synergy - Synergy More Important
**Timestamp:** [00:14:58]  
**Current Evaluation:** While removal was plentiful and necessary for interaction, prioritizing deck synergy was more crucial for success. The best decks combined their synergistic engine with timely disruption.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not stated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "removal was important but Synergy was more important and the removal was plentiful too"  
- "you wanted to be able to interact but not at the cost of your own deck functioning"  
- "popping off with Synergy was more important than having the removal but the best was if you could pop off a Synergy while slightly disrupting your opponent's Synergy"  
**Key Insights:** Overloading on removal at the expense of synergy was detrimental. Interaction was important, but the primary goal was enabling your own powerful game plan.  

### Cross-Archetype Synergy - Viable Strategy  
**Timestamp:** [00:16:15]  
**Current Evaluation:** Unusually for a high-synergy format, MH3 allowed combining halves of different archetypes effectively if the right "glue" cards or interactions were found (e.g., Jund ETB/LTB using Eldrazi Spawn, Jeskai proliferating both counters and energy).  
**Initial Expectations:** This kind of mixing is usually a "recipe for disaster" in synergy formats.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "modern Horizon 3 was unique in that you could have two halves of an archetype that actually played well together"  
- "you actually could like one of the really cool things was there were like little small interactions you could find that like glued these halves together"  
**Key Insights:** The format's design allowed for creative merging of themes, rewarding players who could identify non-obvious connections between different synergistic packages.  

### Synergy vs. Raw Stats - Know Your Goal  
**Timestamp:** [00:17:11]  
**Current Evaluation:** It was important to distinguish whether your deck was aiming for synergistic payoffs (like Energy) or raw aggression/stats (like some Red-White or Green-White aggro builds). Deck construction and card evaluation differed based on this goal.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not stated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "knowing whether you were going after Synergy or raw stats was important"  
- Contrasting "red white energy versus red white aggro" and "green white aggro versus like green white plus one plus1 counters"  
**Key Insights:** Different versions of the same color pair could have distinct game plans, requiring tailored drafting and building approaches.  

### Card Evaluation - Finding Ceilings  
**Timestamp:** [00:17:48]  
**Current Evaluation:** Drafting MH3 effectively meant understanding and maximizing the *ceiling* (potential best-case scenario) of cards within a synergistic shell, rather than relying on their average performance or floor. Data could be misleading without this context.  
**Initial Expectations:** Contrasted with formats where floor/average performance is more key.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "mh3 draft is about finding the ceilings of the cards you draft"  
- "game and hand win rate really didn't tell the whole picture... malevolent Rumble... its stats are extremely Juiced I think based on the cards surrounding it"  
- "you have to be able to... sift through the the packs and thinking about like where am I going to actually get the most bang for my buck out of my picks"  
**Key Insights:** Card value was highly contextual. A card's power level depended heavily on how well it fit into the specific synergistic deck being drafted.  

### Common Playability - Very High  
**Timestamp:** [00:29:58]  
**Current Evaluation:** Almost every common in the set was playable in the right context, indicating a deep and well-designed common pool, unlike some uncommons which were clear "clunkers."  
**Initial Expectations:** Not stated, but noted as a positive quality.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I think every single common in the set is playable"  
- "the lowest game in hand win rate cards are at common are corrupted Shape Shifter... obstinate gargoyle like these cards aren't great by any stretch but like you're you're playing them"  
- "it's stark contrast to the uncommons... boy how there's some Clunkers [among uncommons]"  
**Key Insights:** The depth at common contributed to the format's replayability and the viability of finding open lanes.  

### Arena Availability - Huge Positive  
**Timestamp:** [00:39:00]  
**Current Evaluation:** Having a Masters-style set available on Arena at standard draft prices was a massive boon, increasing accessibility and enabling deeper engagement from the community and content creators.  
**Initial Expectations:** Masters sets were previously less accessible due to platform (MTGO only) and cost.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "Masters formats coming to Arena was awesome more please"  
- "if this hadn't been an arena we would not have been able to devote the amount of content we did to it"  
- "The Listener base certainly wouldn't have been playing it that much"  
**Key Insights:** Arena availability significantly impacted the format's popularity and the depth of analysis possible.  

### Final Format Impression - Cool & Rewarding  
**Timestamp:** [00:39:40]  
**Current Evaluation:** MH3 was a very cool, skill-testing draft format that rewarded exploration, understanding synergy, finding card ceilings, and identifying open lanes. Despite some potentially frustrating elements (like Chrysalis for Ethan), the overall experience was positive and deep.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly compared, but summarizes the positive aspects discussed.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "mh3 was a very cool draft format that rewarded you for exploring how to maximize the best cards"  
- Ben: "no get out of here this format is really good yeah there's a lot of like fun stuff"  
**Key Insights:** The format offered a rich, complex, and rewarding draft experience for those willing to engage with its synergistic nature.  

## Mechanic Evaluations  

### Energy - Got There Big Time  
**Timestamp:** [00:09:00]  
**Current Evaluation:** Energy was a highly successful and powerful mechanic, forming the backbone of several top-tier archetypes (RW Aggro, UW Aggro, UR/Jeskai Control/Midrange). WotC successfully implemented Energy in Limited this time around.  
**Initial Expectations:** Energy had a troubled history (Kaladesh block being too strong).  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "energy decks got there in a big way"  
- "kudos to watti for like Having the courage to go back in like dip back into the energy well which they really kind of screwed up the first time around... I think they really got it right at least for limited"  
- "it's elrazi as tier number one synergies I think to go after an energy not far behind"  
**Key Insights:** Energy was one of the two dominant pillars of the format, offering flexible and powerful strategies across multiple color combinations.  

### Modified (Abzan) - Fell Flat
**Timestamp:** [00:09:48]  
**Current Evaluation:** The Abzan "Modified" theme (combining +1/+1 counters and Auras/Equipment) significantly underperformed. It lacked cohesion, struggled against both Eldrazi and Energy strategies, and its sub-themes didn't synergize well.  
**Initial Expectations:** Was positioned as one of the three main pillars (alongside Eldrazi and Energy) but failed to deliver.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "the modified wedge fell flat which was abzan modified just didn't really get there"  
- "it was kind of at odds with itself"  
- "modified in addition to being the least powerful of those three also had different flavors... mixing and matching didn't work super well"  
- "it just fell in no man's land in the format right it it lost the end game to alrai and it lost the early game or the the mid game to energy"  
**Key Insights:** The Modified theme lacked the power and internal synergy needed to compete effectively in the MH3 metagame. Green-White worked better as pure aggro than as a dedicated counters deck.  

### Landfall - Cool Subtheme  
**Timestamp:** [00:20:34]  
**Current Evaluation:** Landfall, powered significantly by fetchlands, was a potent subtheme. Cards like Reckless Pyrosurfer could be extremely explosive.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not stated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "the fetch lands also powered up landfall which was a really cool subtheme in the format"  
- "some powerful powerful landfall cards Chief among them Reckless pyrro Surfer... that's the first time I realized I like that it's stacked that it's stacked and that that's what fetchlands did my mind kind of like I was doing the like big explosion"  
**Key Insights:** Fetchlands enabled powerful landfall triggers, adding another layer of synergy and explosive potential to decks that could incorporate them.  

## Archetype Performance  

### Red-Green Eldrazi - Best Deck  
**Timestamp:** [00:08:34]  
**Current Evaluation:** Red-Green Eldrazi was the consensus best archetype, driven by the power of Writhing Chrysalis, Titans' Vanguard, and other efficient Eldrazi threats and ramp.  
**Initial Expectations:** They felt they identified this early on, and it proved correct.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "red green eldrazi was the best deck off the back of Chrysalis Titans Vanguard and a host of powerful eldrazi"  
- "shout out to us for calling this after why not... I think we really pegged this early and it bore out to to be the case"  
**Key Insights:** The combination of efficient ramp, powerful threats, and resilience made RG Eldrazi the deck to beat.  

### Temer Eldrazi - Strong Variant
**Timestamp:** (Part of Archetype Rankings [00:12:18])  
**Current Evaluation:** Adding Blue to the RG Eldrazi shell (Temur) was also a very strong strategy, likely leveraging blue's interaction or card draw alongside the core Eldrazi package. Ranked #3 overall.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not stated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- Ranked #3 in the archetype power rankings: "Teamer eldrazi ramp"  
**Key Insights:** The Eldrazi shell was robust enough to support splashing a third color for additional utility.  

### Energy Archetypes (RW, UW, UR/Jeskai) - Top Tier  
**Timestamp:** [00:09:00] & [00:12:18]  
**Current Evaluation:** Red-White Aggro Energy, Blue-White Aggro Energy, and Blue-Red/Jeskai Energy decks were all highly effective and ranked among the top archetypes (#2, #4, #5, #6). They offered different angles of attack using the energy mechanic.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not stated, but their success confirmed Energy as a major pillar.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "energy decks got there in a big way I red white aggro energy blue white aggro energy and blue red which was more like Jess guy"  
- Ranked highly in archetype power rankings.  
**Key Insights:** Energy provided multiple powerful, synergistic decks with different playstyles (aggro, midrange, control).  

### Red-Black Artifacts & Blue-Black Draw-Three - Good but Risky  
**Timestamp:** [00:11:11]  
**Current Evaluation:** Rakdos Artifacts and Dimir Draw-Three were viable and powerful archetypes when they came together, but riskier to draft due to fewer natural pivot options ("off-ramps") if the key cards weren't open.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not stated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "red black artifacts and blue black draw three were good decks but a little riskier to draft because there wasn't an easy offramp"  
- "my train wrecks were red black like feeling like I'm gonna start red black and hold on... and then it just like doesn't come together"  
- "when it worked it was good but your your drafts might blow up in your face a little bit"  
**Key Insights:** These archetypes required a higher degree of commitment during the draft and were less forgiving if contested.  

### Green-White Counters/Beatdown - Mid-Tier/Underwhelming Synergy  
**Timestamp:** [00:10:30] & [00:12:18]  
**Current Evaluation:** Green-White focused purely on aggro beatdown could work (#9 rank), but the dedicated "+1/+1 counter synergy" aspect often felt less powerful or cohesive than other strategies.  
**Initial Expectations:** Part of the "Modified" wedge that generally underperformed.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "green white as pure aggro like if you were ignoring synergies green white as pure aggro worked but like green white as a Synergy counters thing I think didn't"  
- Ranked #9: "Celesnia counters Beatdown"  
**Key Insights:** Focusing on raw stats and curve often worked better for GW than trying to force specific counter synergies.  

### Black-Green Counters/Grind - Underwhelming  
**Timestamp:** [00:10:30] & [00:12:18]  
**Current Evaluation:** Golgari Counters/Grind was generally considered weak (#10 rank). It lacked a clear powerful identity or engine compared to top decks. Winding Constrictor (Cursed Wombat) didn't live up to expectations.  
**Initial Expectations:** Winding Constrictor parallel suggested potential, but it didn't materialize.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "black green didn't really work"  
- Ranked #10: "Golgari counters grind"  
- Discussion around Cursed Wombat [00:14:30]: "it's so powerful... what happened to it... I felt like everything just had to go so perfectly right"  
**Key Insights:** BG lacked the explosive potential or resilient engines of the better archetypes.  

### White-Black Grind - Weakest
**Timestamp:** [00:10:30] & [00:12:18]  
**Current Evaluation:** Orzhov Grind was ranked as the weakest archetype (#11). While it could function as a control deck using cards like Essence Reliquary, it wasn't a primary strategy.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not stated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I like black white but like for finicky fussy decks not like I I just don't think you want to really be doing the air quotes modified thing"  
- "black white I think of as a control Deck with Essence reliquary and a curse Marauders"  
- Ranked #11: "white black grind"  
**Key Insights:** BW lacked a proactive, powerful game plan compared to the rest of the format.  

### Archetype Power Rankings (Summary)  
**Timestamp:** [00:12:18]  
**Current Evaluation:**  
1. Red-Green Eldrazi  
2. Red-White Energy Aggro  
3. Temer Eldrazi Ramp  
4. Jeskai Energy Engines  
5. Blue-Red Energy  
6. Blue-White Energy  
7. Rakdos Artifacts  
8. Dimir Draw-Three  
9. Selesnya Counters Beatdown  
10. Golgari Counters Grind  
11. White-Black Grind  
(Blue-Green implicitly covered by Temur/Dimir)  
**Key Insights:** Eldrazi and Energy strategies dominated the top tiers, followed by Artifacts/Draw-Three, with Modified-based strategies lagging significantly. Wedge strategies (Temur, Jeskai) were notably powerful.  

## Color Pair Results  

### Best/Worst Colors - Red/Green Best, Black Worst
**Timestamp:** [00:13:00]  
**Current Evaluation:** Red and Green were the strongest colors, largely due to Eldrazi and Energy synergies. Black was considered the weakest overall. However, drafting a synergistic *open* deck was far more important than forcing the "best" colors.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not stated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "red and green were the best colors with black bringing up the rear"  
- "but drafting a synergistic deck mattered way more than being in the best colors"  
- "drafting a synergistic open deck mattered way more than being in the best colors"  
**Key Insights:** While color strength existed, format mastery revolved around finding synergy and openness, not just color preference.  

## Card Reassessments  

### Writhing Chrysalis (Common) - Format Defining, Divisive  
**Timestamp:** [00:07:20]  
**Current Evaluation:** Universally acknowledged as incredibly powerful, potentially the best common ever printed in the podcast's era. Ethan felt it bordered on format-ruining, while Ben saw sufficient counterplay in Draft (though acknowledged its dominance in Sealed). It defined the Eldrazi archetypes.  
**Initial Expectations:** Previous "tempered takes" suggest opinions solidified/intensified over time.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- Ethan: "I'm kind of on the side of it being format ruining honestly"  
- Ben: "I disagree completely for draft... sealed absolutely... for draft I don't buy it"  
- Ethan: "it's the most busted common we've ever seen probably"  
**Key Insights:** The card's power level warped gameplay and drafting, making it a central point of discussion and strategy.  

### Cheap Gold Commons (Conduit Goblin, Riddle Gate Gargoyle, Sneaky Snacker, Cranial Ram) - Huge Hooks  
**Timestamp:** [00:13:28]  
**Current Evaluation:** These two-mana gold commons were extremely powerful signposts and rewards for being in their respective archetypes. They were often better than many uncommons and key pickups late in pack one if an archetype was open. Watchdog was considered weaker than the others.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not stated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "the cheap gold Commons especially laid in pack one were huge hooks into the respective archetypes"  
- "those were fun cards to draft fun cards to Pivot for"  
- "the other crazy thing is are these Commons are better than a lot of the uncommons right"  
**Key Insights:** These cards were critical signals and payoffs that rewarded identifying and committing to an open lane.  

### Common Signpost Power Rankings (Summary)  
**Timestamp:** [00:14:08]  
**Current Evaluation:**  
1. Writhing Chrysalis (Colorless/Green)  
2. Conduit Goblin (RG)  
3. Riddle Gate Gargoyle (UW)  
4. Sneaky Snacker (UB)  
5. Cranial Ram (RB)  
6. Faithful Watchdog (GW)  
7. Snapping Voidcraw (UG)  
8. Obstinate Gargoyle (WB)  
9. Cyclops Superconductor (UR)  
10. Expanding Ooze (BG)  
**Key Insights:** The power level varied significantly, with the top commons being format-defining, while others were merely role-players. Commons often outclassed their respective gold uncommons.  

### Fetchlands - Excellent Utility, Not Top Picks Early  
**Timestamp:** [00:19:48]  
**Current Evaluation:** Fetchlands provided incredible utility: fixing colors, enabling splashes, providing colorless mana initially, triggering sacrifice synergies, and powering landfall. Despite this, they weren't typically high early picks; drafting direction first was preferred. Overloading could thin basics too much.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not stated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "the fetchlands do a lot in the format but they aren't super high pit picks early on in the draft"  
- "these lands were absolutely phenomenal one of my favorite parts of the format"  
- "It was odd that they weren't higher picks somehow because they did so so so much"  
**Key Insights:** Fetchlands were powerful role-players best picked up mid-pack once a deck's direction and needs were clearer.  

### Modal Double-Faced Cards (MDFCs) - Great Late, Not Direction Setting  
**Timestamp:** [00:21:28]  
**Current Evaluation:** MDFCs were valuable additions, especially the situational "spell" sides that offered unique effects (board stall breakers, specific interaction). Like fetchlands, they were best picked up once a lane was established, rather than using them to dictate colors early.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not stated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "the mdfc are great but also like the fetch lands don't send you down a direction"  
- "you just naturally if you find the right lane you kind of collect some mdfc of those colors along the way"  
- "the best mdfc were the highly situational ones that could help you win a game or be super impactful" (Examples: Centering Eruption, Suppression Ray, Witch Enchanter)  
**Key Insights:** MDFCs provided flexibility and powerful situational effects, rewarding players who picked them up opportunistically within their established colors.  

### Top Commons by Color (Summary)  
**Timestamp:** [00:18:58]  
**Current Evaluation:**  
- White: Area Auxiliary (Counter dumper)  
- Blue: Tune the Narrative (Energy enabler)  
- Black: Wither and Bloom (Interaction/Ramp - consensus); Acursed Marauder (Higher ceiling - Ethan's pick)  
- Red: Galvanic Discharge (Efficient removal)  
- Green: Malevolent Rumble (Data-backed, versatile); Eldrazi Repurposer also strong.  
**Key Insights:** Identified the key commons driving the successful strategies in each color. Green notably had several strong commons.  

### Acursed Marauder (Common) - Better Than It Looks  
**Timestamp:** [00:24:00]  
**Current Evaluation:** Initially underestimated ("greater garbage"), Acursed Marauder proved to be a very strong black common, particularly effective against decks not prepared for its aggressive, disruptive nature. Ethan considers it the best black common due to its high ceiling.  
**Initial Expectations:** Looked weak or situational.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "a cursed Marauder is way better than it looks and for me is the best black common"  
- "I used to think it was greater garbage... I now think it's either good or great"  
- "usually I am cursing the same way I was cursing when my opponents played hoing ogre on the play against me"  
**Key Insights:** A seemingly simple card whose impact was much higher in practice than on paper, punishing slower or unprepared opponents.  

### Molden Gatekeeper (Common) - Tied Jund Together  
**Timestamp:** [00:24:58]  
**Current Evaluation:** This unassuming 2/3 for 2R was a key synergistic piece in Jund-based sacrifice/ETB/LTB decks, providing consistent damage and value. It was an early "mover up" in evaluations.  
**Initial Expectations:** Looked clunky or low impact.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "molden gatekeeper really tied the room together in the Jun decks"  
- "this was such a huge early mover up but a huge mover up for me in the early days just being like yo this card is great like it's so gluey"  
**Key Insights:** Underscores the importance of "glue" cards in synergistic formats, even if they don't look powerful in isolation.  

### Smelted Charge Bug (Common) - Golden Egg Award  
**Timestamp:** [00:25:38]  
**Current Evaluation:** Awarded the "Golden Egg" for being a cheap, unassuming card that consistently overperformed. Its combination of energy generation, menace, and buffing other attackers made it a must-answer threat in artifact/energy decks.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not stated, but award implies it exceeded expectations.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "the golden egg award goes to smelted charge bug"  
- "I think one of my favorite things about this card is that like it has keyword bad... somehow you're just like I can't kill that but like you kind of have to"  
**Key Insights:** A prime example of a cheap synergistic piece punching well above its weight.  

### Glimpse the Impossible (Uncommon) - Clunky Looking Overperformer  
**Timestamp:** [00:26:10]  
**Current Evaluation:** Awarded the "Imperial Oath" for being a clunky-looking card that massively overperformed. It provided card advantage, ramp (via Spawn tokens), or both, fitting surprisingly well into various decks, including Eldrazi ramp strategies.  
**Initial Expectations:** Looked awkward ("I can't imagine I'm G to be playing this card").  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "the Imperial oath award for clunky looking over performer goes to Glimpse The Impossible"  
- "somehow like every mode is terrifying"  
- "I was watching an lsv video where he was like yeah Glimpse is an alrai card and I was like what... and then I started putting it in elrazi decks and I was like oh okay like yeah I get it"  
**Key Insights:** Card flexibility and unexpected applications (like ramp in Eldrazi decks) made this card much better than its initial reading suggested.  

### Essence Reliquary (Uncommon) - The Real Deal (Build-Around)  
**Timestamp:** [00:27:58]  
**Current Evaluation:** A powerhouse build-around uncommon. Its ability to repeatedly bounce permanents at instant speed enabled numerous powerful interactions: re-triggering ETBs, picking up MDFCs, saving creatures, enabling chump attacks, recurring Sagas, and blanking removal.  
**Initial Expectations:** Seen as "kind of cute" for ETBs, but its full potential (especially with MDFCs, Sagas, dodging removal) wasn't immediately grasped.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "essence requery is the real deal if you build around it"  
- "what doesn't this card do truly"  
- Lists numerous interactions: ETBs, MDFCs, land drops, dodging removal, chump attacks, Sagas.  
- "Saga locks with Essence Relic quary are one of my favoritethings to do"  
**Key Insights:** A high-ceiling card whose value skyrocketed when combined with other specific permanents, showcasing the format's depth of interactions.  

### Solar Transformer (Uncommon) - Excellent Flexible Pick  
**Timestamp:** [00:31:48]  
**Current Evaluation:** An excellent, flexible early pick. It served multiple roles: artifact for artifact decks, colorless mana source/ramp for Eldrazi, energy generation for energy decks, and fixing for splashes.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not stated, but highlighted as a versatile early pick.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "solar Transformer was excellent in energy but also just a great flexible early pick in a format that rewarded finding the right lane"  
- "it was an artifact... tapped for colorless Mana... ramped you from two to four in the eldrazi decks... helped you Splash"  
**Key Insights:** Cards offering flexibility across multiple top archetypes were valuable early picks while staying open.  

### Sagas (Cycle) - Cool Addition, Variable Power  
**Timestamp:** [00:32:38]  
**Current Evaluation:** The saga cycle was a cool addition, but power levels varied greatly.  
- Tier 1: Ral and the Implicit Maze (Red), Ajani Fells the Godsire (White) - Both excellent, synergistic.  
- Tier 1.5: Tamiyo Meets the Story Circle (Blue) - Cool, useful.  
- Near Unplayable: Hunger Tide Rises (Black), Creation of Avison (Green) - Generally too slow or low impact, though Creation had rare high-roll potential (finding Ulamog).  
**Initial Expectations:** Not stated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "the cycle of sagas were a cool addition of the format some more than others"  
- Explicit ranking provided in the transcript.  
**Key Insights:** Not all cycles are created equal; evaluation within a cycle is crucial. Red and White sagas were strong build-arounds.  

### Nesting Grounds (Rare Utility Land) - Best Utility Land  
**Timestamp:** [00:34:18]  
**Current Evaluation:** Considered the best of the rare utility lands, offering unique and powerful ways to manipulate counters (+1/+1, loyalty, lore, -1/-1), enabling strong synergies with various cards.  
**Initial Expectations:** Contrasted with other utility lands that felt "dead."  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "nesting grounds is better than any of the rare utility lands"  
- "nesting grounds still kind of kind of does it for me like it's pretty sweet"  
- Examples: moving counters with Evolution Witness, Ajani Fells the Godsire, Obstinate Gargoyle persist counters.  
**Key Insights:** Utility lands needed powerful, synergistic effects to be worth the slot; Nesting Grounds delivered.  

### Barbarian Ring / Cephalid Coliseum (Rare Utility Lands) - Unplayable  
**Timestamp:** [00:34:58]  
**Current Evaluation:** Strongly advised against playing these lands. The cost (life loss, sacrificing lands, specific thresholds) was deemed far too high for the effect in this Limited format.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not stated, but a strong negative reaction suggests players might overvalue them.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "please do not put Barbarian ring or sehid Coliseum in your decks"  
- "I don't understand people I feel like people really they're like well I actually I have to put Coliseum in my deck... do you also have something that is going to mitigate the four life you're gonna take from this thing like this is terrible"  
**Key Insights:** Not all rare lands are playable; assessing the actual cost vs. benefit in the context of the format is critical.  

### Path of Annihilation vs. Kozilek's Command - Path Much Better  
**Timestamp:** [00:35:38]  
**Current Evaluation:** Path of Annihilation (Eldrazi anthem/ramp) proved significantly better than Kozilek's Command. Getting value upfront (the Spawn token) made Path much more reliable and impactful.  
**Initial Expectations:** Kozilek's Command looked potentially awesome, but the lack of immediate board impact was a major drawback.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "it wasn't Apparent at first but it is now path of annihilation many greater signs better than coel x on ceiling yeah not close to close"  
- "path of annihilation was the coolest eldrazi build around"  
- "Cox on ceiling looked really awesome but the fact that you didn't get anything up front really like that's gonna be a big takeaway for me"  
**Key Insights:** Build-arounds that provide immediate value or board presence are generally much stronger than those requiring setup before impacting the game.  

### Utter Insignificance (Uncommon) - Top Tier Blue Removal  
**Timestamp:** [00:36:18]  
**Current Evaluation:** One of the best blue removal spells seen recently. The combination of turning a creature into a vanilla 1/1 at instant speed (Flash Aura) and then exiling it later provided incredible flexibility and efficiency.  
**Initial Expectations:** Underestimated initially, but performance in practice (especially during Arena Open) led to a higher evaluation.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "utter insignificance is one of the best blue removal spells we've seen in a while"  
- "this is the best variant of turn something into a one- one with no abilities we've ever seen for sure"  
- "I really was not on this card until playing against it a bunch in the arena open it really impressed me there"  
**Key Insights:** Flexible, efficient interaction that answered threats cleanly was highly valuable.  

### Decree of Justice (Rare) - Power Crept
**Timestamp:** [00:36:58]  
**Current Evaluation:** Considered largely unplayable ("an F" or "a D") in MH3, a stark contrast to its historical power level. A symbol of power creep.  
**Initial Expectations:** Legacy name recognition might imply playability.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "pour one out for decree of Justice power creep is real"  
- "how do you feel about the dgr I mean it's an F right like you just don't play it no it's a d you play it sometimes"  
**Key Insights:** Past performance is no guarantee of current viability; cards must be evaluated in the context of the current set's power level.  

### Build-Arounds That Didn't Get There (Muster the Departed, Nadir's Nightblade, Monstrous Vortex)  
**Timestamp:** [00:37:28]  
**Current Evaluation:** These build-arounds generally proved too difficult to assemble or lacked sufficient payoff compared to the format's stronger synergies.  
- Muster the Departed: Too slow/low impact (3 mana for a 1/1 Spirit initially).  
- Nadir's Nightblade: Required too many other specific pieces to function effectively.  
- Monstrous Vortex: Cascade condition (Power 5+) was too restrictive/inconsistent.  
**Initial Expectations:** Might have seemed potentially powerful on paper.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- Listed under "Build arounds that didn't quite get there."  
- Muster: "three Mana for one one Spirit every turn is highly highly medium"  
- Nightblade: "all the other things have to go right and then you get the night blade it's not you're taking night blade and then trying to make it work"  
- Vortex: "it just did not do it no not at all"  
**Key Insights:** Build-around cards need to be efficient, consistent, and offer a payoff commensurate with the deckbuilding cost. These fell short.  

### Propagator Drone (Uncommon) - Explosive with Spawn Tokens  
**Timestamp:** [00:38:28]  
**Current Evaluation:** Could be very explosive, particularly because Eldrazi *cast* triggers make Spawn tokens *before* the Eldrazi creature resolves, allowing the Drone's Evolve ability to trigger immediately off the newly entered Eldrazi.  
**Initial Expectations:** Interaction with cast triggers might have been missed initially.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "propagator drone could be explosive thanks to and I missed this early elrazi making spawn tokens on cast right"  
- "you cast the thing the cast trigger happens it makes the spawn... and then you're getting the uh the Evolve trigger which is really cool"  
**Key Insights:** Understanding the exact timing of triggers (cast vs. ETB) was crucial for evaluating certain interactions.  

### Sketchy Rares That Were Awesome (Summary)  
**Timestamp:** [00:38:58]  
**Current Evaluation:** Several rares/mythics that might have looked awkward or situational proved to be very powerful:  
- **Philia, Exuberant Shepherd:** Highly flexible attacker that could clear blockers, kill tokens, re-trigger ETBs, and grow itself. Much better than a simple 2/2 flash creature.  
- **Cthonian Nightmare:** Initially seemed unplayable, but turned out to be a powerful, repeatable reanimation engine fueled by energy/spawn.  
- **Ether Revolt:** Potentially game-winning engine in energy decks, dealing significant direct damage.  
- **Echoes of Eternity:** Game-ending Eldrazi build-around, doubling spells and triggers.  
- **Eldrazi Mythics (Ulamog, Kozilek, Emrakul):** All castable thanks to Spawn tokens.  
- **Invert Polarity:** Counterspell with a 50% chance to steal the spell, offering immense upside despite the randomness. Better than typical "flip a coin" cards.  
**Initial Expectations:** Many of these looked niche, clunky, or unreliable.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- Detailed explanations provided for each card in the transcript section.  
- Cthonian Nightmare: "I thought this card was going to be borderline unplayable and it is now one of my favorite cards to play with"  
- Invert Polarity: "I had written it off basically because I just write off any card that has flip a coin on it but you're right that the fact that it's it's counter like it's counter Spell slash yeah 50% of the time counter spell that's fractured identity"  
**Key Insights:** Don't dismiss rares based on initial complexity or perceived inconsistency; their ceilings in the right deck or situation could be game-breaking.  

## General Lessons/Observations  

### Templating Issues - Secret Reach  
**Timestamp:** [00:23:28]  
**Current Evaluation:** Poor templating on cards like Writhing Chrysalis and Petrifying Meddler buried the keyword "Reach" within walls of text, making it easy to miss and leading to potential gameplay errors.  
**Initial Expectations:** Clear card layout is expected.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "secret reach is back thanks to some terrible templating on cards like writhing Crystalis and petrifying medler"  
- "there was just a wall of text and then the word reach randomly at the bottom of the car[d]"  
- "the word reach is on the is not like it's not like both of these cards have the word reach at the bottom or the top one of them has it at the bottom and one of them has it in the middle it's just completely deranged"  
**Key Insights:** Careful reading was required, as key abilities could be easily overlooked due to unconventional templating.  

### Suppression Ray - Not Sleep (Bug/Templating Issue)  
**Timestamp:** [00:22:48]  
**Current Evaluation:** Suppression Ray does *not* allow paying energy to keep creatures tapped if they were *already* tapped when the spell resolved. The "tapped this way" clause limits the sleep effect only to creatures the Ray itself tapped. This makes it significantly worse than initially interpreted (like the card Sleep).  
**Initial Expectations:** Assumed it worked like Sleep, allowing energy payment for any tapped creature.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "suppression Ray is not sleep and I am angry about that"  
- "this way means you only get to put the ones to sleep that suppression Ray Taps so if they were already tapped you can't lock them down which makes it significantly worse"  
- "it's horrible templating and made me makes me mad"  
**Key Insights:** Precise wording on cards matters immensely; misinterpretations based on similar cards (like Sleep) can lead to incorrect evaluations.  

### Trample/Flying - King vs. Chump Blockers  
**Timestamp:** [00:28:58]  
**Current Evaluation:** In a format potentially filled with chump blockers (especially Eldrazi Spawn), evasion like Trample (Colossal Dreadmask, Nyxborn Hydra) and Flying was extremely important for closing out games.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not stated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "in a format of seemingly infinite chump blockers trample was King"  
- "trampol and flying both very important in this format"  
**Key Insights:** Evasion was crucial to break through board stalls created by token generators or defensive creatures.  

### Modal Disenchants - Highly Desirable  
**Timestamp:** [00:29:28]  
**Current Evaluation:** Flexible artifact/enchantment removal attached to creatures or versatile charms (Collective Resistance, Siege Smash) was highly valuable due to the prevalence of powerful artifacts and enchantments (engines, build-arounds, sagas). Might have been more important than creature removal.  
**Initial Expectations:** Not stated.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "modal disenchants were highly desirable"  
- "Collective resistance 3man charm Siege smash the creatures that did it... angel of ruins"  
- "artifact and enchantment interaction might have mattered more than creature removal is crazy"  
**Key Insights:** The density of powerful non-creature permanents made flexible answers for them a high priority.
