Okay, here is the analysis of the Lords of Limited transcript discussing their initial impressions of Modern Horizons 3 Limited.  

## Overview  

**Set:** Modern Horizons 3 (MH3)  
**Context:** Initial impressions and evaluations based on Early Access event gameplay (Arena & MTGO). The discussion covers format feel, draft strategies, color/archetype power rankings, key mechanics (Energy, Modified, Eldrazi, Artifacts), fixing, and specific card evaluations.  

## Mechanic Assessments  

### Marionette Apprentice + Eldrazi Spawn Synergy  
**Timestamp:** 0:00:45  
**Take:** Marionette Apprentice's ability triggers off Eldrazi Spawn tokens dying, creating a powerful, potentially unexpected synergy.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "marionette Apprentice which is one black for a one wand has fabricate and whenever a creature or artifact you control dies goes to the graveyard rather um your opponent loses life I didn't realize I think we even talked about it but then I forgot about it how that works with eldrazi spawn tokens"  
- "it's a bit of a splinter twin situation"  
**Confidence Level:** High (Based on direct gameplay experience)  

### Energy - Incremental Value vs. Engine  
**Timestamp:** 0:14:00  
**Take:** Energy in MH3 feels less like a dedicated engine (compared to past sets) and more like an incremental resource used to press advantages or gain snowballing value, usable in both aggressive and controlling decks.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "energy again feels it's it's less of an engine and more of a like an incremental snowbally thing where you're like I have I affected the board in some way and now I'm using this resource to press that Advantage"  
- "rather than how I used to think about energy where it's like I assembled these things and over time I'm recuring value with this free stuff"  
- "you can do that I think that's what blue red can do but I also think assertive decks just take advantage of energy very well as well"  
**Confidence Level:** Medium/High  

### Energy Generation - Sufficient Supply  
**Timestamp:** 0:14:30  
**Take:** While Bespoke Battlewagon is the main repeatable energy *engine*, simply drafting a sufficient density of cards that produce energy provides enough resource to activate energy payoffs effectively.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "the energy cards are just if your deck is full of energy cards you have an excess of of energy to do cool things with energy that has been my experience"  
- "if you if you put a bunch of energy cards in your deck you've got enough energy to do the things you want"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Modified/Counters - Specific Sub-Synergies Matter  
**Timestamp:** 0:16:20  
**Take:** The "Modified" theme involves specific sub-synergies (+1/+1 counters matter, adapt triggers, etc.) that don't always overlap perfectly. Simply drafting "modified" cards isn't enough; the specific *type* of synergy matters.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "Evolution witness wants to do plus one plus one counter things like it doesn't want to do modified like so you could say like Evolution witness and trickster both want to do a modified thing but not really like you have to dig deeper than modified or energy or whatever because there's also a lot of like very specific Sub synergies in those big headliner mechanics"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Eldrazi Ramp - Strong Strategy  
**Timestamp:** 0:08:25  
**Take:** Ramping into large Eldrazi creatures using Eldrazi Spawn tokens appears to be a powerful and effective strategy.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "just ramping eldraziramping just seems really good to me so far"  
- "even though the the blue green Aldrowsy deck that I drafted I thought wasn't that good I faced plenty that were fantastic"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Artifacts - Potentially Underdrafted/Commitment Needed  
**Timestamp:** 0:05:50  
**Take:** The artifact deck felt open in early drafts, potentially indicating it's underdrafted. It might require an early commitment ("gumshoos situation") as there isn't one clear premium signal card, and the deck needs specific pieces (like one-drops) to function well.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I felt like the deck was always it always felt kind of open so I wonder if we have a bit of a gumptions situation on our hands"  
- "I think you could do that I don't love that idea of drafting the format... I think you do have to decide you're going to be drafting artifacts"  
- "you really want a One Drop on turn one significantly less explosive if you don't have a one drop artifact"  
**Confidence Level:** Medium  

### Artifacts - Premium Version Needed  
**Timestamp:** 0:06:20  
**Take:** Artifact decks likely need to be a "premium version" to succeed, as mid-range versions struggle against the size of Eldrazi decks.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "the thing I feel about the artifacts deck is you either want a premium version or you don't want to mess with it like the middle ground is a little murkier just because the eldrazi decks can go so big so fast that if you aren't faster than them like you just lose to giant monsters"  
**Confidence Level:** Medium/High  

## Archetype Predictions  

### Red-Green Eldrazi - Top Tier  
**Timestamp:** 0:10:45 / 0:24:30  
**Take:** Red-Green Eldrazi is considered one of the best archetypes, potentially *the* best, due to powerful gold commons/uncommons and strong synergy.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "red green alrai is nuts I think one of the better archetypes in the format"  
- "[Rything Chrysalis] card is absurd yes I think crysalis is awesome... I think I would put that number one"  
- "[Titan's Vanguard] I'm possibly in the camp of Titans Vanguard is number one"  
- "the overlap of two cards I'm really high on two cards I might be at the top of the list is rything Crysisthe red green common and Titans Vanguard the red green uncommon like red green aggro just seems priced to move"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Green-White Modified/Counters - Top Tier  
**Timestamp:** 0:12:10 / 0:21:15  
**Take:** Green-White, focusing on +1/+1 counters and modified synergies, is predicted to be one of the stronger archetypes, capable of explosive starts.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "green white I think is also awesome so three ofen Green's color pairs again very happy to be I think green White's one of again one of the stronger archetypes in the format"  
- "I think I would put number two faithful Watchdog green white for Z vigyetbs with three plus one plus1 counterson it I think starts with faithful Watchdog from green white decks are some of the most explosive starts you can have in the format"  
- "[Golden-Tail Trainer] I think this card's really impressive"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Red-White Aggro - Top Tier  
**Timestamp:** 0:08:05 / 0:10:55  
**Take:** Red-White Aggro (potentially leveraging energy/landfall) is very strong and performs better than initially expected.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "speaking of aggressive decks the red white aggro deck that I drafted... I was crazy impressed by"  
- "it played out much better than I expected there's lots of again little synergies landfall energy stuff happening"  
- "I think red white aggro Beatdown is also very strong very good yes that's that's my feeling"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Red-Black Artifacts - Good (Disagreement on Tier)  
**Timestamp:** 0:10:40 / 0:25:50  
**Take:** Red-Black Artifacts is considered good, possibly very good (Ben's view), relying on cards like Cranial Ram and Refurbished Familiar. Ethan is less sold, viewing it as potentially Tier 1.5 even when it comes together.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- Ben: "red black artifacts is very good... Yes I feel pretty strongly that it's good"  
- Ethan: "I feel like red black is a little too like even even if all the pieces come together you're getting a tier 1.5 deck I just have to respectfully disagree at the moment"  
- Ben: "I played a not even a premium red black artifacts deck I would was crazy impressed with cranial Ram plus refurbished familiar"  
**Confidence Level:** Medium (Due to disagreement on exact power level)  

### Blue-Based Archetypes (UB, UG, UW) - Lower Tier  
**Timestamp:** 0:12:30 / 0:26:15  
**Take:** Blue archetypes (Control, Tempo Flyers, Eldrazi Ramp) are generally ranked lower. Blue's gold cards are weaker, its commons less impactful (outside Tune), and its strategies lack the synergistic overlap or raw power of other colors. Blue often pulls drafters in too many directions.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "blue and last mostly because the the blue archetypes just don't quite get there as much the gold Commons aren't as good the gold uncommons aren't as good"  
- "opposite of red blue pulls you in a lot of different directions and there's not tons of overlap"  
- "basically blue is energy because the best common is tune The Narrative"  
- "the bottom tier would be blue black blue green blue white and then white black that's bad bad look for blue"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Black-White - Lower Tier / Needs Specific Build  
**Timestamp:** 0:04:45 / 0:26:15  
**Take:** Black-White can function as a grindy/aggressive deck or lean into artifacts if key commons (Mandibular Kite, persist flyer) are available, but is generally considered lower tier.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "got into it what ended up performing is a good black white deck nothing special just sort of like black white nuts and bolts kind of grindy could be aggressive type deal was it artifact based or no it was not really artifact based"  
- "you were absolutely right about that that black white can do that and one of the reasons it can do that is it's signpost common... the fact that that is an artifact creature... and mandibular kite is really good... those two cards that common I think are really what make black white artifacts viable"  
- "[Bottom Tier includes] white black"  
**Confidence Level:** Medium  

### Archetype Tiers Summary  
**Timestamp:** 0:25:20  
**Take:** Ben groups RG, GW, RW, UR, RB, GB as Tier 1. Ethan proposes Tier 1: RG, GW, RW (Naya); Tier 2: UR, GB, RB; Tier 3: UB, UG, UW, WB. Both agree Naya colors are top, and Blue-based decks are lower.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- Ben: "maybe it's red green green white red white A Cut Above the Rest but certainly those three are in tier one one along with blue red red black and green black I think those would be the top six archetypes for me"  
- Ethan: "I think I would split these into three tiers and I would say Nia is in tier one and then I'd put those three in tier two... and then like the bottom tier would be blue black blue green blue white and then white black"  
**Confidence Level:** Medium/High (General agreement on top/bottom, slight disagreement on middle)  

## Color Pair Analysis  

### Red - Best Color  
**Timestamp:** 0:10:20  
**Take:** Red is ranked as the best color due to its versatility, strong performance across all its color pairs (RB Artifacts, RG Eldrazi, RU Energy, RW Aggro), and flexible commons that fit multiple archetypes.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I feel pretty strongly that red is number one based on I think its versatility"  
- "I think red all of red's color pairs are good"  
- "lots of Reds Commons do double duty... it has powerful Commons and it's also got very flexible Commons"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Green - Second Best Color  
**Timestamp:** 0:11:55  
**Take:** Green is ranked second best, with strong pairings in RG, GB, and GW. UG is considered weaker. Green excels at +1/+1 counter and Eldrazi strategies.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I think green number two"  
- "very happy with red green very happy with green black and I think blue green a little bit less um and green white I think is also awesome"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### White - Third Best Color  
**Timestamp:** 0:12:25  
**Take:** White is ranked third, slightly ahead of Black. It primarily wants to be aggressive, excelling in GW (Counters/Modified) and RW (Aggro/Energy).  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "white I would have in third right now slightly ahead of black"  
- "[White] primarily want to do plus and plus1 counters modified things maybe some energy stuff in red white and then lastly kind of artifacts but similar to red white gets to play in a lot of different spaces just with always an aggressive Focus I think" (0:33:55)  
**Confidence Level:** Medium  

### Black - Fourth Best Color  
**Timestamp:** 0:12:25  
**Take:** Black is ranked fourth, potentially interchangeable with White. It leans towards Artifacts (with Red) or Modified/Counters/Sacrifice (with Green).  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "maybe I could see those flip-flopping [White and Black]"  
- "if you're starting black you want to do something with artifacts primarily and then maybe secondarily modified stuff but pairs best with red and green so if you're black you're probably in the Jun space I think" (0:33:25)  
**Confidence Level:** Medium  

### Blue - Worst Color  
**Timestamp:** 0:12:30  
**Take:** Blue is ranked last. Its archetypes are less powerful, gold cards weaker, and it lacks synergistic flexibility compared to colors like Red. It primarily leans towards Energy control strategies.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "blue and last mostly because the the blue archetypes just don't quite get there as much"  
- "opposite of red blue pulls you in a lot of different directions and there's not tons of overlap"  
- "basically blue is energy because the best common is tune The Narrative"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

## Card Evaluations  

### Rything Chrysalis (RG Common) - Absurdly Good  
**Timestamp:** 0:20:55  
**Take:** Considered one of the best, if not the best, multicolor common. Absurdly powerful for its cost, enabling very strong RG starts.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "ring crysalis two red green for the two three and whenever you cast it you make two eldrazi spawn it's got reach also... that card is absurd yes I think crysalis is awesome"  
- "if I ranking I think I would put that number one"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Faithful Watchdog (GW Common) - Excellent
**Timestamp:** 0:21:15  
**Take:** A top multicolor common enabling some of the most explosive starts for the strong GW archetype.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I think I would put number two faithful Watchdog... I think starts with faithful Watchdog from green white decks are some of the most explosive starts you can have in the format"  
**Confidence Level:** High (Ben's take, Ethan defers)  

### Cranial Ram (RB Common) - Good, but not Top Signal  
**Timestamp:** 0:07:05 / 0:21:45  
**Take:** A good card, crucial for the RB artifacts deck, but not necessarily a top-tier signal card to force the archetype anymore. Support might be less great than initially thought. Ethan still very impressed by it with flyers.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- Ben: "I don't think it is that card anymore I I just don't think that's like it's a good card but I'm not seeing cranial RAM and going oh snap because I don't think the support is that great for cranial Ram unfortunately"  
- Ethan: "I played a not even a premium red black artifacts deck I would was crazy impressed with cranial Ram plus refurbished familiar like being able to put the RAM on a flyer mhm was really strong"  
**Confidence Level:** Medium (Slight disagreement on overall impact/signal strength)  

### Cursed Wombat (BG Uncommon) - Top Tier Uncommon  
**Timestamp:** 0:22:50  
**Take:** Potentially the best multicolor uncommon. Its ability doubles +1/+1 counter *triggers* (not just counters), making cards like Evolution Witness incredibly powerful.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "number one cursed swbat black green for a two three... this means you get double triggers from all of your adapt things... Evolution witness is now getting two things... this is so dumb which is just wild"  
- "cursed swbat is the best one I think"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Titan's Vanguard (RG Uncommon) - Top Tier Uncommon  
**Timestamp:** 0:23:35  
**Take:** Potentially the best multicolor uncommon alongside Cursed Wombat. Provides massive stats on cast and snowballs incredibly quickly if unanswered.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "you are very high on Titans Vanguard and I think I'm I'm willing to coign... I'm possibly in the camp of Titans Vanguard is number one and I love cursed wombat"  
- "this is Ridge scale tusker it is a five Mana 55... this is like five Mana for you know let's say eight let's say conservatively 88 power and toughness on cast and then if this isn't killed on site it's attacking as a 66 and then everything else gets another counter"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Golden-Tail Trainer (GW Uncommon) - Impressive/Explosive  
**Timestamp:** 0:24:00  
**Take:** Surprisingly explosive due to its cost reduction ability, enabling huge mana turns when combined with pump effects, leading to overwhelming board states.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "the thing that's not apparent is how explosive it is Mana wise... it just gives you so much Mana if you can get its power up to three or four or something like that and then you dump all this modified stuff onto the battlefield... I think this card's really impressive"  
**Confidence Level:** High (Ben's take)  

### Evolution Witness (Green Common) - Excellent / Top Green Common?  
**Timestamp:** 0:15:10 / 0:57:20  
**Take:** Initially underrated, now seen as truly excellent and potentially the best green common. Provides a recursive engine, works incredibly well with counter synergies (especially Wombat), and is a kill-on-sight threat.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "Evolution witness which I think is the best green common card is great... this card's great it's truly excellent and one of the reasons to be green"  
- "if you're playing against it it's kill on sitelike you you cannot leave this thing laying around on the battlefield"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Eldrazi Repurposing (Green Common) - Very Good / Top Green Common?  
**Timestamp:** 0:15:25 / 0:33:05  
**Take:** Also a top green common contender. Provides ramp via spawn tokens on cast and death, fitting well into Eldrazi strategies. Ethan potentially ranks it higher than Witness.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "eldrazirepurposing common twoa green for 3three devoid when you cast it and when it dies you make a nrai spawn"  
- Ethan: "I think the the stupid the 3 three that makes spawns on ETB and dies is better [than Evolution Witness] like I know you don't think that right now but like I I think time will tell"  
**Confidence Level:** High (Considered top tier, exact rank debated)  

### Smelted Charge Bug (Red Common) - Excellent / Top Red Common?  
**Timestamp:** 0:11:25 / 0:40:15  
**Take:** An excellent, flexible common fitting into multiple Red archetypes (Aggro, Artifacts, Energy). Forces opponents to race due to menace and pump ability, synergistic, and leaves value (energy) even if killed.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "the smelted charge bug... it's good in artifact Synergy decks it's good in basic aggressive decks like red white it's makes energy for your blue red energy decks it's an artifact for red black"  
- "it it basically forces your opponent to race because it makes their life absolutely miserable for defense"  
- "charge bug is awesome"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Molten Gatekeeper (Red Common) - Surprisingly Good / Synergistic  
**Timestamp:** 0:29:40  
**Take:** Initially seemed like artifact filler, but has broad cross-synergy in Jund (ETB/dies triggers with tokens), RW (go-wide), and RB (artifact type). Much better than expected.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "Molton Gatekeepers two in a red for a 23... this is the type of card that's got tons and tons and tons of cross Synergy that's not immediately apparent"  
- "gatekeeper goes well in red white which is go wide and gatekeeper also playing well as we said in red black right so it's playing well in two go wide spaces with the etbs and playing well with its types"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Tune the Narrative (Blue Common) - Best Blue Common  
**Timestamp:** 0:13:05 / 0:51:50  
**Take:** Clearly the best blue common. Instant speed card draw plus energy generation is efficient and fuels blue's primary strategy (Energy).  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "the best common is tune The Narrative"  
- "if you get into blue you're getting into blue for tunes and if you if you're picking Tunes you have to play energy"  
- "tune The Narrative is very good"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Aerie Auxiliary (White Common) - Excellent / Best White Common?  
**Timestamp:** 0:58:05  
**Take:** Very impressive, potentially the best white common (Ben argues yes over Inspired Inventor). Fits perfectly into white's aggressive strategies and has a very high ceiling by pumping the team.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "area auxiliary this has been very impressive as well... feel pretty confident that area auxiliary is the best white Comon"  
- "it does what I think white does best which is like body... auxiliary is four Mana for five five two which has haste right now um and three of which has flying"  
**Confidence Level:** High (Ben's take, acknowledged difference in grading philosophy)  

### Inspired Inventor (White Common) - Very Good / Flexible  
**Timestamp:** 0:16:55 / 0:58:30  
**Take:** A very good and flexible white common that fits into multiple synergy spaces (Energy, Modified). Has a higher floor than Aerie Auxiliary.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "inspired inventor which is the two and a white 2 two and then can either make a one one three energy or put a plus plus one counter on something all three of those cards want you to play in the energy space"  
- "the floor on inspired inventor is much higher in the draft and in the game play the ceiling on area auxiliary is higher"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Wormcoil Larva (Black Uncommon) - Underperformer  
**Timestamp:** 0:42:50  
**Take:** Seems to be an underperformer. Awkward fit in many black decks (Artifacts, BG ramp), primarily defensive, and vulnerable to chump sacking via Eldrazi Spawn. Considered worse than Dreadmobile. Example of raw power not matching synergy.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I think this card is basically only good if you're defensive... it's awkward that I don't think it's that good in the artifact deck"  
- "I've not been that impressed by it and I think your shout that dread mobile is a better black uncommon than this is absolutely right"  
- "worm Coril larva is back to the point of power versus Synergy worm Corais a very intrinsically powerful card that's not that synergistic in the format"  
**Confidence Level:** High (Negative evaluation)  

### Serum Visionary (Blue Common) - Disagreement
**Timestamp:** 0:45:30  
**Take:** Disagreement on its quality. Ethan found it annoying when played against him, suggesting it might be decent filler everywhere. Ben was unimpressed and happy to see opponents play it.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- Ethan: "every time my opponent cast it I was like that's kind of annoying... I think it's like just good I think it's just a good card"  
- Ben: "I'm going to push back disagree I think I haven't been impressed and I think every time my opponent has played seran Visionary I'vethought okay I'm pretty happy"  
**Confidence Level:** Low (Split opinion)  

### Sage of the Unknowable (Blue Common) - Bad  
**Timestamp:** 0:46:30  
**Take:** Evaluated as not good, a "pretty big dud," contributing to blue's overall weakness.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "this card's not great right yeah... this card's not great I thought this would be good in blue green eldrazi ramp whatever like this car is just not good it's a pretty pretty big dud I think"  
**Confidence Level:** High (Negative evaluation)  

### Malevolent Rumble (Green Common) - Good (Especially BG)  
**Timestamp:** 0:46:55  
**Take:** Ethan is high on this card, potentially top 3 green common. Excellent in BG (card selection, ramp/sac body, graveyard fuel) and good in Eldrazi ramp (digs for threats/enablers).  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "you're pretty high on this card I think I've come upon it but I still I haven't seen it enough to really know"  
- Ethan: "it might be like just a black green gold card because that's really where you're getting all the the pieces... I think this card just really it's its Synergy possibilities are really high"  
**Confidence Level:** Medium/High (Ethan's strong positive take)  

### Nixborn Hydra (Green Uncommon) - Disagreement
**Timestamp:** 0:52:25  
**Take:** Disagreement. Ben sees it as a decent 1-of mana sink in big green ramp decks to grant trample. Ethan thinks it's too inefficient and narrow, and decks don't need it.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- Ben: "I think you want one in the green big Mana decks... giving something trample and making it bigger is a great way to push through"  
- Ethan: "I'm gonna push back and I don't think this card is very good because what you're describing like those there is no shortage of stuff to do in the big Mana space and this is so inefficient"  
**Confidence Level:** Low (Split opinion)  

### Viscera Seer's Insight (Black Instant) - Good 1-of  
**Timestamp:** 0:54:00  
**Take:** The first copy is very good in most black decks, offering card draw with synergy for sacrifice, artifacts, and graveyard strategies via flashback. Has diminishing returns.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "the first copy of this is very good I think in every black deck it's at the intersection of draw three for blue black sacrifice stuff graveyard value it just does so much"  
- "I've really liked divis Raider's Insight yeah I I agree with you on like it's got diminishing returns but I think the first copy is something a lot of black deexwant"  
**Confidence Level:** High (On the first copy)  

### Phyrexian Ironworks (Red Uncommon) - Good Energy Sink  
**Timestamp:** 0:55:00  
**Take:** Primarily valuable as an excellent energy sink, turning energy producers into efficient token generation, rather than being a primary energy source itself.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "what you actually want is the energy sync like you want you want to be able to this is just a good place to put energy"  
- "all of a sudden all your things that make three energy instead of like they're a 2 two plus a 3 three for three manner yeah which is insane right"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Breaker of Creation (Colorless Uncommon) - Strong but Expensive  
**Timestamp:** 0:56:10  
**Take:** Very strong effect (life gain scales with colorless permanents including lands, hexproof, Annihilator 2), especially stabilizing vs aggro, but balanced by its very high mana cost (8 mana).  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "the thing I didn't realize about this was it counts lands... my opponent cast this and they gained 12 or something"  
- "this card you ramp this out against aggro it singlehandedly just grinds the game to an absolute halt yeah well and the hex per from each color just means like you can't kill it outside of combat"  
- "it's so much Mana though it is a lot of man so much Mana I I I'm not sure how great this card is"  
**Confidence Level:** Medium/High (Strong effect, cost is significant drawback)  

### Fang-Slither Skeleton (Red Sorcery) - Good Removal  
**Timestamp:** 1:00:30  
**Take:** Good, efficient removal spell. The exile clause is relevant against graveyard synergies and persist. Considered good, but Ben doesn't rank it among the very top red commons (prefers threats/Discharge).  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "one in red for a common devoid deals four damage to our creature Plains Walker if it would die this turn Exile it instead... every time it's been cast against one of my cool creatures... it's been pretty backbreaking the exile's been relevant"  
- Ben: "let's not misconstrue me saying I don't think it's that one of the top three red Commons with I don't think this card is good okay so you do think it's good I think it's good"  
**Confidence Level:** High (Good card, placement debated)  

### Mindless Conscription (Black Enchantment) - Broader Than It Looks  
**Timestamp:** 1:01:20  
**Take:** While it looks like a UB "draw three" payoff, it's synergistic beyond that. Provides a modified body upfront, works with black's self-contained draw (Insight, Gargantua), gets boosted by Wombat, enables modified payoffs, and interacts with Nesting Grounds. Encourages looking for cross-synergies.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "this is a type of card where you see this and you think oh this goes in blue black but I would encourage you to try to look outside that for a lot of cards"  
- "this combines great with eviscerator Insight... FedEd Gargantua... it's already good enough on its own and then if you ever hit that combination... it can just kind of pop off"  
- "this gets this is a 44 with cursed swbat... gives you an additional modified creature... gives you gives you a tower of counters for nesting grounds"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Fetch Lands (Common Land Cycle) - Incredible / High Picks  
**Timestamp:** 0:35:10  
**Take:** The common fetch lands are incredibly powerful and versatile, enabling splashing (color and colorless), providing mana fixing, triggering landfall twice, enabling sacrifice synergies, shuffling for effects like Brainsurge, and occasionally cycling. They are very high picks.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "the fetch lands are incredible and I think a huge part of the format"  
- Lists numerous benefits: "enables splashing... enable colorless splashing... uncracked etes give you access to that... evolving Wilds can tap for Mana the turn you play it is also great insanely powerful... double landfall triggers... enable cards that care about you sacrificing non-token permanence... shuffle those two away... cycle them to draw a card"  
- "these fetch lands like they just do so so so so much I think that was the biggest difference between the arena Early Access and the mtgo Early Access to me was I I came in thinking the fetch lands were going to be very high picks"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### MDFCs (Spell Lands) - Good / Replace Lands  
**Timestamp:** 0:37:05  
**Take:** The MDFCs are generally good, with situationally powerful ones being particularly impressive. They should replace lands in the deck, increasing the total land count based on the number included (Ben's heuristic provided).  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I was really impressed by the situationally powerful ones... like these situational things where you wouldn't ever put that card alone in your deck but then all of a sudden you're like oh I don't need a land but I do love putting plus five plus five on a creature right now like they're really good"  
- "My Philosophy is they always replace lands one to one... if you have two to three I would bump your land count up to 18... if you have four to five mdfc bump your land count up to 19 lands and if you have six or more your land count is 20 lands"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

## General Strategy & Format Feel  

### Highly Synergistic Format
**Timestamp:** 0:28:25  
**Take:** The format is extremely synergistic, even more so than anticipated. Success comes from combining cards effectively, often leading to unexpected interactions ("didn't know I got to do that"). Reminiscent of Ikoria in complexity and synergy potential.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "this format's highly synergistic way more so even than I would have thought"  
- "the amount of times I've thought oh I didn't know I got to do that yes it's just been like way way way more"  
- "the last time I felt like this I think as far as like synapses firing and like getting endorphins from like cool things happening was ioria"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Synergy Trumps Raw Power  
**Timestamp:** 0:28:55  
**Take:** Powerful synergies are more prevalent and impactful than individually powerful cards. Decks win through combinations rather than single bomb rares.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "powerful Synergy we trumps individual power because there just isn't a lot of individual power"  
- "there's a lot more powerful Synergy to be had than there is intrinsic power"  
- "you're not losing to one card you're losing to a combination of three cards if you're losing your opponent drafted well generally"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Draft Strategy: Focus on Synergy Spaces  
**Timestamp:** 0:14:50 / 0:34:20  
**Take:** Staying "open" means finding cards within the same *synergy space* (Energy, Modified, Artifacts, Eldrazi) rather than just staying in one color if those cards pull in different directions. Prioritize drafting cards that work together early on.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "you could start with all three of these cards [Evolution Witness, Eldrazi Repurposing, Trickster's Elk] and think well I'm one color I'm super flexible but really you've got three different decks going on"  
- "I feel more on track and more open with a start of three cards of three different colors that want to play in the same Synergy space than I do for example all three of those green cards"  
- "starting big [synergy space] and then honing your way in during the draft is I think the the best way I found to approach it so far"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Aggression Needs Evasion (Flying/Trample)  
**Timestamp:** 0:07:35  
**Take:** Aggressive decks need flying or trample to effectively close games, as Eldrazi Spawn tokens provide readily available chump blockers that clog up the ground.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I've been feeling very strongly that either you want to be if you're trying to be aggressive you either need to be attacking in the air or you need to have trample like because the eldrazi spawns just make life miserable if you're trying to attack on the ground without trample"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Format Depth Rewards Knowledge  
**Timestamp:** 0:42:30  
**Take:** While drafting basic archetypes is possible, the format heavily rewards deep knowledge of card interactions and cross-synergies during the draft.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "the other thing that format's going to do is it's going to reward depth of knowledge so heavily yeah during the drafts"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Shift Focus to Uncommons (Play Boosters)  
**Timestamp:** 0:27:10  
**Take:** Due to Play Boosters changing pack composition, the focus in Limited evaluation and drafting should shift more towards uncommons, as they form the core of decks more than commons traditionally did.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I do think we have to shift how we're thinking about Commons with play boosters... I think on un commmonshave to be at the level... the focus shifts to uncommons because I don't think gone are the days where your deck is like 14 Commons"  
**Confidence Level:** High (Strong opinion presented)
