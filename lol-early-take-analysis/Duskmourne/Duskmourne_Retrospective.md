## Overall Format Assessment

### Duskmourn Balance and Intricacy - Highly Balanced and Beloved
**Timestamp:** 00:09:58
**Current Evaluation:** Duskmourn is considered one of the most balanced, intricate, and widely beloved draft formats in recent memory, with very few complaints observed. The fact that 9 out of 10 archetypes were viable is seen as incredibly high.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted, but the tone suggests it met or exceeded high hopes for balance and depth.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "I can't remember the last time a set was now maybe it won't be goat status for too many people or whatever but a set was by all accounts like beloved by I didn't see anyone complaining about this format and Magic players love to complain."
- "I think the green white survival didn't work but I think that's honestly maybe a boon for the format because if it had worked it might have oppressed other archetypes that were cool and fun to play."
- "Nine out of 10 ain't bad that is not what we usually get yeah N9 out of 10 is incredibly High."
**Key Insights:** High format balance and near-universal positive reception are rare. The failure of one archetype (Green-White) might have paradoxically contributed to the overall health and balance by preventing it from oppressing others.

### Format Complexity and Summarization - Difficult to Summarize Concisely
**Timestamp:** 00:24:00
**Current Evaluation:** The format's depth, nuance, and variety make it very difficult to summarize with a simple elevator pitch. The best approach is understanding the different "buckets" or macro-archetypes available.
**Initial Expectations:** Ben notes his usual ease in summarizing formats was challenged by Duskmourn's complexity.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "Dorn is advanced enough that it's difficult to summarize distinctly."
- "I had a lot of trouble getting these 50 takes down... usually you're this is something you're so good at is like the the concise packaging..."
- "If I if I had to do a sentence to summarize the format... I would say know which bucket of DUS more and you're drafting..."
**Key Insights:** The format's richness requires a deeper, more nuanced understanding than simple heuristics allow. Its complexity is a feature, not a bug.

### Duskmourn "Dusk Money" / Stealing Games - Frequent "Gotcha" Moments
**Timestamp:** 00:11:18
**Current Evaluation:** The format featured numerous ways to steal games unexpectedly ("Dusk Money"), often through combinations of cards rather than single bombs (e.g., Act of Treason + Double Strike + Pump). Awareness and playing around these possibilities became crucial as the format evolved.
**Initial Expectations:** This was identified early as a characteristic ("Dusk Money" was an early term).
**Supporting Statements:**
- "dusk should have been called dusk mone... there were a ton of ways to steal games out of nowhere."
- Ben's Arena Open story: "...my opponent stole it with the act of treason had the double strike card and had the plus three plus o just Dome me out in the air from 18."
- "here it was just so many combinations right you're talking about turn inside out plus maybe the the plus one plus double strike with delirium trick..."
- Ethan's Cursed Recording win: "...chained those together to dome my opponent out from eight with double double tormenting voice with cursed recording over two turns..."
**Key Insights:** Format rewards vigilance, preserving life total, and understanding common multi-card combo finishes across different color pairs.

### Rares: Powerful or Laylines - High Variance in Rare Quality
**Timestamp:** 00:44:00
**Current Evaluation:** The format contained both extremely powerful rares and significant duds ("Laylines"). Experiences varied wildly between players. Ethan argues that the presence of low-power rares is actually beneficial in the Play Booster era to balance pack power levels and prevent rares from completely dominating.
**Initial Expectations:** Ben experienced many duds early, while Ethan saw more powerful rares.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "depending on who you are dmor offered a lots of powerful rares or lots of lay lines."
- Ethan: "my hot take maybe is that I think it's good that there are lay lines in the format too... there need to be some rares that are blanked if packs are going to have two and three rares you can't just have every rare be a banger..."
**Key Insights:** Rare quality is highly variable. The inclusion of "dud" rares might be a necessary design choice for balancing formats with potentially multiple rares per pack.

### Overall Format Ranking / GOAT Status - Best Set of 2024, Potential GOAT
**Timestamp:** 01:09:45
**Current Evaluation:** Confidently declared the best set of 2024, surpassing even Modern Horizons 3 for limited play. It exhibits strong "GOAT" (Greatest Of All Time) characteristics. Ben's continued enthusiastic drafting until the very end is cited as strong evidence of its quality. The main complaint was the distracting Arena board visuals.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted, but a powerful final endorsement.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "feel confident in this first part duskborn is the best set of 2024 I I would I would agree with that as well..."
- "I think this set has serious goat Vibes..."
- "I cannot remember the last set that you you Ben wory were happily drafting until its like Final hours."
- "the worst part of this format is the board on Arena having a billion lights shining at you..."
**Key Insights:** Duskmourn is considered an exceptionally high-quality, deep, and engaging limited format. Sustained player engagement is a key indicator of format greatness.

## Drafting & Strategy

### Draft Openness and Variety - Highly Refreshing and Unpredictable
**Timestamp:** 00:13:19
**Current Evaluation:** Drafting Duskmourn felt very open and refreshing, lacking predictability. There was a wide variety of viable archetypes, and significant niche deck-building decisions existed even within established color pairs.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "when you sit down to a dust draft you don't know what's likely to happen or what your deck is likely to be and it is very refreshing..."
- "I certainly think there's a wide variety of archetypes that are viable..."
- "so much Niche deck building decisions that happen... it made it's part of what made the format feel so open."
**Key Insights:** The format rewarded flexibility, deep synergy knowledge, and adapting to the specific cards seen during the draft, rather than forcing predetermined archetypes.

### Avoiding Early Narrowing - Stay Flexible Unless Given Strong Signals
**Timestamp:** 00:15:50
**Current Evaluation:** It was generally best to avoid committing to colors/archetypes early unless presented with a sequence of powerful, synergistic cards. White-based aggro decks (UW, WR) were the most common archetypes where early commitment could pay off due to strong common support and key uncommons.
**Initial Expectations:** Implies a learned strategy based on experience.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "try to avoid narrowing down early unless you really get a series of powerful cards right off the bat."
- "the two most common archetypes for that were probably blue white and white red to narrow in early..."
- Ben: "...didn't really want to start white also because I felt like it led to less interesting drafts..."
**Key Insights:** Flexibility is rewarded. White aggro decks could sometimes justify early commitment, but staying open allowed access to the format's diverse possibilities.

### Deck Building Puzzle - Balancing Synergy, Power, and Fundamentals
**Timestamp:** 00:29:20
**Current Evaluation:** Building successful decks required juggling multiple factors: ensuring cards synergized ("pull in the same direction"), including individually powerful cards, and incorporating essential limited elements like interaction, curve, and ways to fuel mechanics (Delirium, Reanimate, etc.). This complexity was a rewarding aspect of the format.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "getting all your cards to pull in the same direction as your best cards while still packing interaction was the name of the game."
- "that is a lot to juggle..."
- "checking those boxes that was part of I think why we like this format so much is those puzzles were there to solve..."
**Key Insights:** Format rewards thoughtful, holistic deck construction that balances synergy, individual card strength, and core limited principles.

### Splashing Difficulty - Tough Unless Base Green
**Timestamp:** 00:47:45
**Current Evaluation:** While fixing (Terramorphic Expanse, dual lands) was available, splashing was generally difficult unless the deck was base Green. Non-Green decks needed multiple specific fixing sources. Green decks could speculate on splashes more easily.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "there was a lot of fixing available in duskborn but it was tough to Splash if you weren't base green."
- "you probably had to have either double terramorphic expanse plus a duel or double on color duel plus a terramorphic expanse..."
- "if you were base green you could pretty aggressively speculate and assume I will probably be able to get the fixing..."
**Key Insights:** Green had a distinct advantage in accessing splashes. Other color combinations required dedicated effort and specific cards to splash reliably.

---

## Mechanics Evaluations

### Delirium - Easy to Achieve, Still Interesting
**Timestamp:** 00:30:25
**Current Evaluation:** Delirium was the easiest it has ever been to enable, largely thanks to artifact creatures and enchantment creatures. Despite this ease, it still presented interesting draft and deckbuilding choices (e.g., valuing card types, finding ways to get types into the graveyard). Its successful implementation was crucial for the format's overall success.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted, but highlights the successful design.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "delirium was the easiest it's ever been to achieve yet it still required interesting draft and deck building considerations."
- "putting in the artifact creatures the enchantment creatures all that sort of stuff was just a huge win for the format."
- "unlocking that aspect [cards providing multiple types, like Turn Inside Out] of a lot of cards really showed what the depth of the format had to offer."
**Key Insights:** Smart inclusion of multi-typed permanents made Delirium function smoothly. Understanding subtle ways to enable Delirium (combat tricks, specific removal) added strategic depth.

### Rooms - Powerful New Split Card Type
**Timestamp:** 00:33:15
**Current Evaluation:** Rooms were a powerful and successful new mechanic, effectively acting as split cards. While the initial hype for a dedicated UR Rooms deck didn't fully materialize due to difficulty assembling the right pieces, the individual Room cards were generally strong and synergistic, especially with Eerie.
**Initial Expectations:** Initially overestimated the dominance of the UR Rooms *deck* based on the power of individual Rooms ("leap with some logical fallacies").
**Supporting Statements:**
- "rooms were a new split card type and they were P powerful yeah so powerful that we thought blue red rooms was just going to blow everybody out of the water week one."
- "that take didn't turn out to pan out... but the rooms themselves... rooms are great cards."
- "every room was a split card like that that was potentially three Eerie triggers..." (Correction: Usually two Eerie triggers unless it put an enchantment onto the battlefield).
**Key Insights:** Individual card power doesn't automatically translate to archetype dominance. Rooms offered flexibility and valuable synergy points.

### Eerie - Cool, Synergistic Archetype Enabler
**Timestamp:** 00:34:25
**Current Evaluation:** Eerie synergized effectively with Rooms, enabling cool and potentially explosive archetypes (especially UW). The full potential wasn't always obvious pre-play (e.g., Optimistic Scavenger + Elegant Rotunda). Even individually weaker Rooms became playable due to their type and Eerie synergy.
**Initial Expectations:** The explosive potential and the value of weaker Rooms in Eerie decks were likely underestimated initially.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "Eerie goes hand in hand with rooms as a cool archetype that could really pop off."
- "didn't quite know how explosive optimistic scavenger into elegant rotunda was going to be..."
- "even the ones that weren't individually powerful... almost made it into a good enough Magic card."
**Key Insights:** Synergy can significantly elevate card value. Play experience is crucial for understanding potential explosiveness. Eerie could be a central theme or a smaller value package.

### Manifest Dread - Flavorful and Synergistic Success
**Timestamp:** 00:36:30
**Current Evaluation:** Manifest Dread was considered a success in terms of flavor and synergy (despite Ben's dislike of the name). It integrated well with Delirium and posed interesting deckbuilding puzzles regarding creature density versus face-down spells. It functioned both as an A+B synergy mechanic and a general value/enabling mechanic.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted, but viewed as well-implemented.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "manifest dread was a win on flavor and Synergy maybe a fail on naming if you're Ben but a win in all respects for sure."
- "bleed with delirium we've already talked about that's so cool..."
- "deck building requirements this was something I was really having a hard time with early on... my creature count maybe wasn't that high..."
- "it was a plus b but it was also somehow at the same time you were happy to use it as like a plus b plus C plus d..."
**Key Insights:** The mechanic successfully combined synergy, value, and deckbuilding challenges. Balancing creature count was a key puzzle.

### Survival - Fell Flat, Possibly Beneficially
**Timestamp:** 00:37:50
**Current Evaluation:** The Survival mechanic and the associated Green-White archetype largely failed. Attacking-related mechanics that don't directly *help* the attack are often difficult to make work. Its failure might have been a net positive for format balance, preventing White-based aggro from becoming overly dominant across three color pairs (RW, UW, GW).
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted, but the analysis explains *why* it likely failed.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "Survival fell flat as a mechanic and an archetype in green white."
- "mechanics about attacking that don't help you attack are tough."
- "if green white is even good... then all of a sudden you're so highly incentivized to start white... format just gets out of whack."
- "I think it's a boon for the format that this archetype didn't pan out."
**Key Insights:** Mechanic design needs to align closely with the archetype's goals. An underperforming archetype can sometimes contribute to better overall format balance.

### Reanimate - Value Recursion, Not Combo Cheating
**Timestamp:** 00:39:00
**Current Evaluation:** The Reanimate theme (primarily Black-White) functioned more as a value engine for recurring answered threats (like Shroud Stomper) rather than a way to cheat expensive bombs into play early. This required a mental shift from typical "Reanimator" strategies seen in formats like Cube. Exile-based removal was the key counterplay.
**Initial Expectations:** Might have initially been viewed through the lens of cheating big threats into play. Experience revealed its role as grindy value/recursion.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "reanimate was less about cheating threats into play and more about reliably recurring them after they were answered."
- "I think this was a mental shift for me..."
- "if you just build a functional Deck with powerful things to reanimate... having way to get that back... that was more the way to think about it."
**Key Insights:** Mechanics should be evaluated within their specific format context. Duskmourn's Reanimate was about card advantage and resilience, not explosive combo plays.

## Archetypes & Colors

### Archetype Overview ("Buckets") - Diverse and Viable Landscape
**Timestamp:** 00:24:35
**Current Evaluation:** The format's viable strategies were grouped into: White Aggro (RW, UW), Green Delirium decks (GR, GB, Jund, GB splash U), Teamer Manifest Dread (distinct from pure Delirium), and a diverse "Unique Decks" category (RB Sac, BW Reanimate, UR Rooms, UB Eerie, etc.). Emphasized that even niche decks were strong when built correctly.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- Lists the buckets: "White aggro", "green delirium decks", "Teamer manifest dread decks", "Unique decks".
- "so many of the archetypes also felt like two archetypes themselves..."
- "you have to know how to draft them [Unique Decks] or you're absolutely giving up Equity..."
**Key Insights:** Provides a useful framework for navigating the format's possibilities. Many decks blended elements or defied simple two-color definitions. Mastering niche archetypes was important.

### Archetype Viability - High Across the Board (Except GW)
**Timestamp:** 00:26:38
**Current Evaluation:** Nearly all defined archetypes (9 out of 10 color pairs) were viable and draftable, offering great flexibility. Green-White Survival was the only significant exception. Even niche decks felt rewarding and didn't require sacrificing equity when drafted correctly.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "survival to draft with the exception of green white survival in most cases."
- "you didn't feel like you were giving up equity in this format to get Variety in your life."
**Key Insights:** Exceptional archetype diversity and balance, making draft navigation flexible and rewarding.

### Color Power Rankings - Not Very Helpful, High Balance
**Timestamp:** 00:27:05
**Current Evaluation:** A tentative ranking was offered (Red > Green > Blue > White > Black), but strongly caveated as not being a particularly useful way to approach the highly balanced format. Black and Blue were potentially underrated. Starting color preference depended more on desired archetype than abstract color strength.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "Color Power Rankings not really a super helpful way to approach duskmourn..."
- "black and blue might have been the most underrated across the just the lifespan of the format."
- "I think this is the least practical or least helpful it's ever been to do so [provide color rankings]."
**Key Insights:** High color balance rendered traditional power rankings less meaningful. Synergy and archetype fit mattered more than raw color power.

### Top Tier Decks - Slight Edge to UW, RB, GB, Teamer
**Timestamp:** 00:28:20
**Current Evaluation:** While balance was high, Blue-White Eerie Tempo, Red-Black Sacrifice, Green-Black Delirium, and Teamer Soup (Manifest Dread/Delirium variants) were identified as being a slight notch above the rest. This was often attributed to their powerful gold uncommons.
**Initial Expectations:** Ethan notes he drafted a lot of Red-White early, suggesting a potential shift in perception or just personal preference evolution.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "the decks in the format that were a slight Notch Above the Rest..."
- Lists: "blue white Eerie Tempo red black sacrifice green black delirium and teamer soup..."
- "I think that was due to I think their gold uncommons being just a little bit better..."
**Key Insights:** Certain archetypes, often enabled by key gold uncommons, consistently performed at the highest level.

### Rooms Deck Difficulty - Hard to Assemble Effectively
**Timestamp:** 00:36:00
**Current Evaluation:** The dedicated "Rooms deck" (often implying Blue-Red) rarely came together optimally. The best Room cards were highly contested by many decks, and the archetype required both the Rooms *and* premium defensive speed/interaction, a combination that was difficult to assemble consistently.
**Initial Expectations:** Contrasts with the initial hype based on the power of individual Room cards.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "despite rooms being powerful the rooms deck rarely came together because everyone wanted the really good rooms."
- "you did need to have premium defensive speed alongside your rooms it was it was a tough ask..."
**Key Insights:** High demand for key synergistic pieces and specific support requirements made the dedicated UR Rooms strategy inconsistent.

## Card Evaluations

### Uncommons Matter More Than Commons - Uncommons Dictated Direction
**Timestamp:** 00:17:15
**Current Evaluation:** Uncommons, particularly gold uncommons, were the primary drivers of draft direction and overall deck power level. Most commons served as role-players rather than strong signals or reasons to commit to a color. This is seen as a potential characteristic of the Play Booster era.
**Initial Expectations:** Contrasted with the expectation that *Foundations* (a core-set style format) might see commons matter more.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "duskborn really exemplified the thought of uncommons matter more than Commons..."
- "very few of them [commons] matter in the sense of dictating your direction in draft."
- "in duskmourn the uncommons is where it's at."
- "one of the cool things too was I think this is one of the places it felt best to take gold uncommons like the gold uncommons were just Banger after Banger..."
**Key Insights:** Prioritize evaluating and securing key uncommons, especially gold ones, during the draft. Commons generally fill curves and support roles.

### Top Commons - Interaction is Key
**Timestamp:** 00:18:27
**Current Evaluation:** The top common in each color was identified: White (Trapped in the Screen), Blue (Unable to Scream), Black (Final Vengeance), Red (Scorching Dragonfire), Green (Spine Seeker Centipede). Notably, four out of five are removal spells.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- Lists the top commons.
- "four removal spells and a bit of a two for one..."
**Key Insights:** The most impactful commons were primarily efficient interaction.

### Importance of Exile/Non-Graveyard Removal - Crucial Against Synergy
**Timestamp:** 00:19:00
**Current Evaluation:** Common removal spells that exiled the target (Trapped in the Screen, Final Vengeance, Scorching Dragonfire) or neutralized it without sending it to the graveyard (Unable to Scream) were extremely valuable. They bypassed graveyard synergies like Delirium and Reanimate.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted, but highlights a key strategic learning.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "the commas that mattered were interaction and interaction that exile and or removal that didn't send stuff to the graveyard was a huge deal."
- Lists the specific commons again.
- "that's huge absolutely huge."
- "nice to be able to combat and get gone permanently."
**Key Insights:** Prioritizing removal that circumvents graveyard synergies was a key strategic advantage in Duskmourn.

### Final Vengeance & Unable to Scream - Top Tier Commons Re-evaluated
**Timestamp:** 00:19:50
**Current Evaluation:** Final Vengeance was initially underrated by Ethan due to a perceived need for sacrifice fodder, but recognized later as backbreaking. Unable to Scream is considered the best version of the "pacifism" effect printed, superior to cards like Witness Protection due to making the creature 0 power (unable to block effectively or participate in double blocks) and the context of powerful rares in Duskmourn.
**Initial Expectations:** Ethan undervalued Final Vengeance initially. The comparison to Witness Protection shows a refined understanding based on play.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "final Vengeance was the one that took me longest to come around..."
- "couldn't quite get out of my head... that I needed sacrifice fodder..."
- "Unable to scream is is definitely the best version of this effect we've ever seen."
- "I think not not being able to do damage not being able to participate in double blocks I think all of that matters..."
**Key Insights:** Overcoming initial biases is important for accurate card evaluation. Subtle differences in card effects and format context significantly impact card strength.

### Playability of Most Commons - Deep Common Pool
**Timestamp:** 00:21:08
**Current Evaluation:** While few commons dictated draft direction, almost all commons were playable and could perform well in the right deck context. This depth meant even late picks ("the wheel") could offer valuable role-players (e.g., Found Footage, the 1/4 Room attendant) if used thoughtfully.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "despite most Commons not quote mattering they almost all were playable and performed well if you were thoughtful about the right home."
- "there's less Commons and so there's not really going to be junker Commons anymore..."
- "pretty rerewarding to get them [weaker commons] to be good enough like in a deck."
**Key Insights:** Even lower-tier commons had potential homes. Deep format knowledge allowed leveraging the entire common pool effectively.

### Card Context Dependency (e.g., Say its Name) - Value Fluctuated Wildly
**Timestamp:** 00:14:48
**Current Evaluation:** The value of many cards, like "Say its Name," depended heavily on the specific deck being drafted. It could range from a key enabler to completely cuttable based on the deck's strategy (e.g., all-in Manifest Dread vs. grindy Delirium vs. Red-Green beats).
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "a card like say its name could either be a card your deck really wanted or that you would cut depending on the cards surrounding it."
- "the power level of the cards fluctuated wildly depending on what direction your draft was going in."
**Key Insights:** Card evaluation required constant contextual assessment based on the specific synergies and needs of the deck being drafted, rather than relying on static pick orders.

### Two-Type Creatures (Artifact/Enchantment Creatures) - Essential for Delirium
**Timestamp:** 00:32:15
**Current Evaluation:** Creatures with two types (e.g., Clockwork Percussionist, Fear of Lost Teeth) were crucial ("a must") for decks focused on achieving Delirium quickly and reliably. They significantly eased the process of getting four card types into the graveyard.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "Creatures with two types were a must if you cared about delirium."
- Lists examples: "Clockwork percussion as an artifact creature fear of lost teeth as an enchantment creature..."
**Key Insights:** Prioritizing creatures with multiple relevant types was a key heuristic for drafting effective Delirium decks.

### Landcyclers - Perfectly Balanced and Flexible
**Timestamp:** 00:40:25
**Current Evaluation:** The landcyclers were praised for being perfectly balanced – impactful but not broken, flexible but not always auto-includes. Their value varied, but they often served as valuable mana-smoothing early and relevant threats late, sometimes acting as a pseudo-18th land. Ranking: Black > Green > Red > Blue > White.
**Initial Expectations:** Ben rated them higher initially than Ethan, who came around, especially seeing their value as Manifest Dread flip-up threats.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "the land cyclers the perfect amount of playable and Powerful."
- "they were they were really well balanced... nailed the power level."
- Gives ranking: "black number one... green... red... blue... white..."
- Ethan: "...started to to sell me was having them as just random things you could flip up in manifest dreed decks..."
- Ben: "liked them as a pseudo 18th land because a lot of a lot of the Decks that I played them in were Mana hungry decks..."
**Key Insights:** Well-designed utility cards that offer flexibility across different stages of the game. Their value assessment depended on the specific deck's needs.

### Clockwork Percussionist - Overrated and Underrated Simultaneously
**Timestamp:** 00:42:15
**Current Evaluation:** This card was seen as overrated by initial data/hype but potentially underrated by players who didn't recognize its fit. While not intrinsically powerful, it excelled in most Red decks (RW, RG, RB) due to being two types, aggressive, and/or sacrifice fodder.
**Initial Expectations:** Was the "hotness on day one," potentially seen as the best common. Ethan felt he underrated it; Ben felt he rated it correctly.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "Clockwork percussionist was both overrated and underrated."
- "I think the data overrated the card... this was the best common in the set."
- Ethan: "I underrated it... almost all the red Decks... made good use of this card."
- Ben: "I still maintain you needed to put this card in the right deck for it to be a good card."
**Key Insights:** Card evaluation must consider context and fit within prevalent archetypes. A card can be non-powerful in a vacuum but excellent due to synergies in its primary color(s).

### Cursed Recording - Best Build-Around, Format Defining for Ben
**Timestamp:** 00:45:15
**Current Evaluation:** Hailed by Ben as the clear best build-around uncommon in the set. Drafting decks that could pivot into Cursed Recording became a favorite strategy for him. It seemed more readily available in Best-of-One queues.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted, but became a format-defining card for Ben through experience.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "cursed recording best build around of the set and I don't think it's close I think it is a slam dunk."
- "my favorite part of this format currently is drafting such that in case I get a cursed recording I can instantly pivot."
- "you get cursed recording way more often than you do in best of three..."
- Ben estimates drafting "closer to 15" Cursed Recording decks.
**Key Insights:** Powerful build-around uncommons can significantly shape a player's format experience and strategy. Card availability might differ between Bo1 and Bo3.

### Sporogenic Infection vs. Nowhere to Run - Infection Likely Better
**Timestamp:** 00:46:30
**Current Evaluation:** A late-format realization that Sporogenic Infection is likely better than Nowhere to Run. While both kill a creature and leave an enchantment, Infection's potential upside (killing the best threat *and* shrinking another) gives it a significantly higher ceiling.
**Initial Expectations:** This comparison emerged late in their evaluation process.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "wait was sporogenic infection better than Nowhere to Run yeah you know like... I I think it is right."
- "it does the same thing right... but also the fact that like the upside of sporogenic infection... ceiling on infection is way higher."
**Key Insights:** Continuous re-evaluation of cards, even similar ones, is important. Ceiling matters, and Sporogenic Infection was likely underrated.

### Top 10 Gold Uncommons - Archetype Defining Powerhouses
**Timestamp:** 00:48:30
**Current Evaluation:** Provided a ranked list, highlighting the immense impact of the top gold uncommons in defining the strongest archetypes. 1. Brood Spinner, 2. Oblivious Bookworm, 3. Gremlin Tamer, 4. Disturbing Mirth, 5. Arabella, 6. Midnight Mayhem, 7. Inquisitive Glimmerfang, 8. Growing Dread, 9. Wildfire Wierdfolk, 10. Sawblade Skin-Ripper. The top 5 were considered "bangers."
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- Provides the ranking.
- "the top five are bangers... that's just what pushed those archetypes a notch Above the Rest."
**Key Insights:** Gold uncommons were extremely influential, significantly boosting the power level of their respective color pairs/archetypes.

### Holy Trinity of Blue Commons - Key Instant-Speed Package
**Timestamp:** 00:49:50
**Current Evaluation:** Glimmerburst (draw), Vanish from Sight (bounce/interaction), and Twist Reality (counterspell) formed a core "Holy Trinity" of instant-speed commons for Blue decks, providing card advantage and interaction. This package was complemented by Unable to Scream.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- Lists the cards: "glimmer burst vanish from sight and twist reality."
- "this Trinity is g[onna] exist in foundations as well and it's probably a trinity worth just keeping your eye on in all sets..."
- "certainly this Holy Trinity was also helped out by having unable to scream to draw into..."
**Key Insights:** A reliable package of instant-speed draw, interaction, and countermagic at common can define Blue's strategic identity in a format.

### Jump Scare & Turn Inside Out - Format Defining Combat Tricks
**Timestamp:** 00:50:50
**Current Evaluation:** Both were identified as format-defining combat tricks. Ethan initially championed Jump Scare, but Turn Inside Out was ultimately seen as superior due to its added Delirium enabling potential. Revealed personal blind spots, with Ben never casting Jump Scare and Ethan never casting Turn Inside Out.
**Initial Expectations:** Ethan favored Jump Scare early; appreciation for Turn Inside Out's full utility grew over time.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "jump scare and turn inside out were format defining combat tricks."
- "I was a champion of jumpscare early... I do think turn inside out was A Cut Above..."
- "Do you know I think this is a true statement you've never cast jump scare I've never cast turn inside out."
**Key Insights:** Key combat tricks heavily influence gameplay. Even experienced players can develop surprising format-specific blind spots.

### Golden Egg Award (Glimmer Light) - Best Colorless Glue
**Timestamp:** 00:51:45
**Current Evaluation:** Glimmer Light received the "Golden Egg" award for the best colorless common/glue card (honorable mention: Clockwork Percussionist). It fit into every deck, providing fixing and filtering. It was initially underrated by the broader community, leading Ben/Ethan to get it later than expected early on, but its value became more recognized over time.
**Initial Expectations:** They rated it highly from the start; the community perception lagged.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "the golden egg award goes to I'm going glimmer light."
- "I think honorable mention to Clockwork percussionist..."
- "glimmer light really did could go in every deck."
- "I was so much higher on this card than the rest of the world early in the format..."
- "I think people warmed up to it as the format went on..."
**Key Insights:** Versatile colorless commons offering mana fixing and card selection are valuable "glue." Community perception doesn't always align immediately with expert evaluation.

### Artifact/Enchantment Removal - Maindeckable, Prioritize Instant Speed
**Timestamp:** 00:52:50
**Current Evaluation:** Artifact and enchantment removal was generally maindeckable due to the prevalence of targets (Rooms, typed creatures, etc.). Breakdown the Door (instant, modal) was considered the best, followed by Exercise (hits creatures, but sorcery). Cathartic Parting (shuffle effect) was downgraded over time due to being sorcery speed and potentially dead.
**Initial Expectations:** Cathartic Parting was initially rated higher but fell off.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "Artifact and especially enchantment removal was maindeckable."
- "I think the best of them break down the door... I also really liked exercise..."
- "cathartic parting was one I went down on over the course of the format... sorcery speed just and sometimes Dead made it quite not quite good enough."
**Key Insights:** Prioritize instant speed and modality in specialized removal. Avoid maindecking cards that can be completely dead in some matchups if possible.

### Bashful Beasty (Imperial Oath Award) - Clunky Overperformer
**Timestamp:** 00:55:55
**Current Evaluation:** Bashful Beasty (4G 5/4, Manifests on death) won the "Imperial Oath" award for a clunky-looking card that overperformed. It looked like generic filler but provided crucial board stability, often leaving behind a blocker even when removed (unless exiled).
**Initial Expectations:** Looked like a replaceable "big dumb five drop."
**Supporting Statements:**
- "the Imperial oath award for clunky looking over performer go two bashful beasty."
- "bashel beasty does look like ah whatever... no this is this is A Cut Above the Rest in a lot of decks."
- "the fact that it you knew you were stable likely after playing a bash BC even if they killed it... the fact that you still had a blocker... was really nice."
**Key Insights:** Value creatures that provide resilience or value upon death, especially for stabilizing the board against aggression. Don't dismiss cards based purely on stats.

### Top Uncommon of Each Color - Key Power Cards
**Timestamp:** 00:56:45
**Current Evaluation:** Identified the top uncommon in each color: White (Sheltered by Ghosts), Blue (Unnerving Grasp, with Fear of Isolation close), Black (Oasis Stick Twister), Red (Painter's Studio // Toofaced Gallery), Green (Under the Skin). These were seen as premium picks.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- Lists the cards.
- Discusses alternatives/contention, especially in Blue and Red. "I feel very strong about I think all of those."
**Key Insights:** Identifies the chase uncommons to prioritize within each color.

### Oblivious Bookworm - Lived Up to the Hype
**Timestamp:** 00:58:15
**Current Evaluation:** This gold uncommon ("LeBron James of Duskmourn") fully lived up to its significant pre-set hype. It provided immediate value (loot) even if answered and overwhelming card selection/advantage if left unchecked. It was strong even outside dedicated Manifest Dread decks due to fueling Delirium.
**Initial Expectations:** Was heavily hyped before release.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "Oblivious Bookworm was the LeBron James of of dust M was hyped leading in and lived up to the hype all format long."
- "you felt terrible if you couldn't kill it..."
- "they already got a little value out of it [loot] even if you answer it..."
- "didn't even have to be all in on manifesting dread it was still just a good card giving you a free loot every turn yeah helped fuel delirium..."
**Key Insights:** Cards offering repeatable card selection/advantage are extremely powerful. Sometimes, pre-set hype is justified.

### Cryptid Inspector & Bashful Beasty in UG - Key Commons for Beatdown UG
**Timestamp:** 00:59:15
**Current Evaluation:** These two commons were crucial components of the *beatdown* versions of the Blue-Green Manifest Dread deck. Cryptid Inspector, in particular, could grow very large quickly. Both were often available late in the draft ("on the wheel"), rewarding dedicated drafters.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "crypted inspector and bashful beasty were key parts of the all-in blue green manifest red deck and I think specifically the Beatdown versions of this deck."
- "Crypton inspector growing... could get Crypton inspector to a 67 in a hurry..."
- "this was a dream for the deck was that you'd get this on the wheel yes and I think you should if you drafted it right."
**Key Insights:** Specific commons can be vital role-players for particular builds of an archetype. Leveraging late picks is key for synergistic decks.

### Most Valuable Slayer - Overrated Initially, Still Solid
**Timestamp:** 01:00:05
**Current Evaluation:** Most Valuable Slayer was initially overrated (compared to Combat Professor) but remained a solid card, considered the #3 Red common. Its 4-mana cost made it less impactful than initially hoped. It's better than Fear of Being Hunted P1P1.
**Initial Expectations:** Was thought to be "the nuts," potentially on par with Combat Professor from Strixhaven. This proved overly optimistic.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "most valuable Slayer was I think again simultaneously overrated and maybe underrated though maybe just largely overrated."
- "we all thought that was going to be the nuts right we're talking about that as combat Professor... didn't quite pan out it is that good it's just four Mana..."
- "it's a solid number three [Red common] and it's a very good solid number three."
**Key Insights:** Direct comparisons across formats can be misleading due to context (mana cost, format speed, power level). Even slightly overrated cards can still be strong performers.

### Begrudgingly Playable Cards (for Delirium) - Type Matters
**Timestamp:** 01:01:20
**Current Evaluation:** Identified several cards often played primarily for their card type to enable Delirium, even if suboptimal otherwise: Found Footage (Artifact), Friendly Teddy (Artifact), Grasping Longneck (Enchantment), Appendage Amalgam (Enchantment), and sometimes Manifest Destiny (Enchantment).
**Initial Expectations:** Manifest Destiny was noted as a card that fell significantly from initial expectations.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "the official Lords of limited list of begrudgingly playable cards if you needed another card type for delirium."
- Lists the cards.
- "Manifest dread... that might be the card that moved down the most I think that we were hottest on going in..."
**Key Insights:** In synergy-driven formats, sometimes playing a weaker card is correct if its type enables powerful payoffs like Delirium.

### Malevolent Chandelier - Niche Anti-Decking Tool, Ultimately Not Good
**Timestamp:** 01:02:40
**Current Evaluation:** While the *idea* of using Malevolent Chandelier to prevent decking was explored, it rarely proved necessary or effective. The card is ultimately considered not good, and decks relying on it likely could have been drafted better.
**Initial Expectations:** There was hope it could be a real strategy ("wanted this to be a thing so bad").
**Supporting Statements:**
- "malevolent chandelier rarely came up as a way to not deck."
- "I think it's not good ultimately..."
- "I think those decks could have been saved from losing by drafting better decks honestly."
**Key Insights:** Niche strategies often prove less effective than strong fundamentals. The exploration phase of a format can be interesting even if specific cards don't pan out.

### Defiled Crypt // Cadaver Lab - Fun Build-Around with Synergies
**Timestamp:** 01:04:30
**Current Evaluation:** A fun build-around uncommon that synergized well with ways to exile cards from graveyards, notably Ghost Vacuum (which could trigger it on the opponent's turn) and Alquist Proft. The 2/2 tokens being Enchantments added further synergy with Eerie.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "defiled Crypt and cadabra lab was a fun build around best friends with ghost vacuum..."
- "learning all the ways you could get stuff out of the yard..."
- "the two tws were enchantments so they were triggering Eerie stuff for you..."
**Key Insights:** Build-around cards can create unique gameplay patterns. Seemingly narrow effects (like graveyard hate) can become relevant based on format mechanics.

### Promising // Central Elevator - Real Win Condition, But Matchup Dependent
**Timestamp:** 01:05:35
**Current Evaluation:** Considered "more meme than dream" but acknowledged as a legitimate, albeit slow and potentially unreliable, win condition. Very strong in control mirrors but vulnerable to aggro/tempo. Ben had been beaten by strong versions but hadn't successfully piloted it himself.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "it's more meme than dream but promising stairs and Central elevator is a real win condition in the format."
- "maybe not if you're in day two of the Arena open."
- "I've gotten smashed by some great promising stairs Central elevator decks."
- "there's also a matchup element going on there too..."
**Key Insights:** Some powerful win conditions are highly matchup-dependent. Niche strategies can be potent in the right circumstances but lack general robustness.

### Noran, Swift Survivalist - Surprisingly Versatile 1-Drop
**Timestamp:** 01:06:35
**Current Evaluation:** This 1-mana creature offered surprising utility: blinking attackers (like Arabella) for value/protection, recasting Patch Plaything without counters, and enabling casting spells (like Scorching Dragonfire) or playing lands revealed via Manifest Dread from exile.
**Initial Expectations:** Not explicitly contrasted.
**Supporting Statements:**
- "noren Swift survivalist did some really cool things in the format."
- Lists examples: "attack with Arabella... blink it recast it", "patch play thing you can recast...", "manifest dread... what if it's a scorching dragon fire then you get to Exile it and cast that..."
- "the card had a lot of play to it for for being a one Mana 2 one that couldn't block."
**Key Insights:** Even seemingly simple, low-cost creatures can have complex and powerful interactions within a synergistic format.

### Let's Play a Game - Late Discovery, Underrated Disruption
**Timestamp:** 01:08:35
**Current Evaluation:** A card they discovered the power of late in the format. It paired well with Cursed Recording (doubling the effect) and was effective against go-wide strategies that Black removal sometimes struggled with. The discard two effect proved more disruptive ("oppressive") than initially assumed.
**Initial Expectations:** Was a "late stage format discovery."
**Supporting Statements:**
- "let's play a game was a late stage format Discovery for us."
- "discovered this card in tandem with recur cursed recording ooh have you've doubled this oh I've doubled this baby..."
- "this really cleaned that up [go-wide boards]."
- "it just took me like getting mind rotted a couple times to be like oh that's actually pretty oppressive in this format..."
**Key Insights:** Deep formats can yield strategic discoveries even late in their lifespan. Re-evaluating cards based on specific pairings or matchups can reveal hidden strength.

## Key Combos & Interactions

### Top 5 Wombo Combos - High-Synergy Plays
**Timestamp:** 00:54:05
**Current Evaluation:** Highlighted several powerful interactions:
1.  Waltz of Rage + Deathtouch creature (e.g., Flesh Bough) = Plague Wind effect.
2.  Double Fear of Burning Alive / Fear + Glass-Work Shattered Yard = Extra damage triggers.
3.  Manifesting creatures with restrictive casting costs (e.g., Acorny Oculus, 3-mana 5/4 Trample) bypasses the restrictions.
4.  Enduring Courage + Midnight Mayhem = Massive lifelink haste swing.
5.  Triple Say its Name into Alquist Proft, Thrice Called = Potential Turn 2 Alquist activation.
**Key Insights:** Identified specific high-impact synergistic plays that defined powerful moments in the format.

### Most Valuable Slayer + Fear of Being Hunted - Strong RW Combo
**Timestamp:** 01:00:05
**Current Evaluation:** This combination could put opponents in "the abyss," creating a recurring threat that demanded an answer. While both cards were perhaps slightly overrated individually initially, the synergy remained potent.
**Key Insights:** Highlights a key synergistic interaction within the Red-White archetype.

### Shard Mage's Rescue + Ethereal Armor / Optimistic Scavenger - UW Protection & Synergy
**Timestamp:** 01:07:35
**Current Evaluation:** Shard Mage's Rescue was "best friends" with Ethereal Armor and especially Optimistic Scavenger in Blue-White decks. It provided crucial protection while also triggering Eerie/Scavenger abilities. The threat of holding up one white mana for this interaction was significant.
**Key Insights:** Cheap interaction that also advances your synergistic game plan is extremely powerful. UW had unique access to such effects.

### RB Kindling (Clockwork Percussionist / Fear of Lost Teeth) - Early Game Engine
**Timestamp:** 01:03:35
**Current Evaluation:** These two 1-drop creatures (Artifact Creature and Enchantment Creature) were essential "kindling" for Red-Black decks. They enabled low curves, provided sacrifice fodder, offered two types for Delirium, and justified playing velocity cards like Derelict Attic.
**Key Insights:** Cheap, multi-purpose creatures are vital for enabling aggressive and synergistic strategies like RB Sacrifice/Delirium.
