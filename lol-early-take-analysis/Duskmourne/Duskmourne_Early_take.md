Okay, here is the analysis of the provided transcript, focusing on predictions, hot takes, and evaluations for the Magic: The Gathering set Duskmourn: House of Horror, based on early play experiences.  

## Overview  

**Set:** Duskmourn: House of Horror (implied by mechanics and card names)  
**Context:** This analysis is a re-evaluation based on early play experiences (Early Access, pre-release) following the hosts' initial "Crash Course" impressions. The hosts explicitly state they are "walking back" many of their initial predictions, particularly regarding the relative power levels of the core mechanics (Manifest Dread vs. Rooms) and the viability of different archetypes. The format dynamic seems defined by a tension between strong aggressive decks and powerful late-game "Rooms" decks.  

## Mechanic Assessments  

### Manifest Dread - Weaker than initially expected, requires specific support
**Timestamp:** 00:05:15  
**Take:** Manifest Dread is not intrinsically powerful but synergistically powerful, primarily in Delirium decks or dedicated Blue-Green decks with specific payoffs (like land cyclers or value creatures). It's more fragile and deck-building constrained than initially thought.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "it's not just intrinsically powerful like it is synergistically powerful when you care about the graveyard when you care about delirium"  
- "you do kind of have to either put it in the right home which is delirium in my mind or or I guess be blue green manifest dread with the you know payoffs"  
- "figuring out how to build manifest dread decks optimally is going to be I think a big piece of the puzzle"  
- "it also is reliant on several cheap creatures that if they die and you're flipping a bunch of tutus... your deck is doing Stone nothing and it feels pretty bad"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Rooms - Much stronger than initially expected, format-defining  
**Timestamp:** 00:07:40  
**Take:** Rooms are significantly better than anticipated. The good ones provide excellent value at a good rate, act as mana sinks, enable late-game inevitability, and trigger Eerie. They function like flexible kicker/learn+lesson cards and push the format towards aggro vs. late-game poles.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "we were way too low on rooms so I think rooms are just good cards which is something I missed"  
- "you just get like good effect for usually good rate and then massive Mana sync that is also going to be good effect good rate somewhere down the line"  
- "they all trigger Eerie like so I think rooms being good cards makes Erie a lot better"  
- "the good ones are very good and you don't even have to be the rooms deck to want the good ones because they're just cards with kicker but you don't have to pay the kicker cost at the same time"  
- "the rooms deck wins the late game so hard"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Eerie - Stronger due to Rooms being good  
**Timestamp:** 00:08:45  
**Take:** Eerie's stock has gone up significantly because Rooms are good cards and frequently trigger it. This makes Eerie-focused decks (like Blue-White) much more viable. The fact triggers aren't once-per-turn is also very powerful.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "they all trigger Eerie like so I think rooms being good cards makes Erie a lot better"  
- "I think we thought rooms were not going to be good cards and therefore we were down on Eerie so Eerie stock goes way up along with room stock going way up"  
- "it's also crazy that the Eerie triggers are not once per turn"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Survival - Underperforming, weak mid-range strategy  
**Timestamp:** 00:11:00  
**Take:** Survival feels like a poor mid-range strategy. It struggles on the draw, lacks good common two-drops, requires enabling attacks, and gets outclassed by Rooms in the late game. It's considered a bottom-tier archetype.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I'm pretty down on Survival"  
- "it's not a good aggro deck and it's not a good late game deck and it's not it actually honestly it's not a particularly good deck period"  
- "there aren't a lot of good two drops with survival and rightfully so because it would snowball too much I think but then once you get to the three drops it's you do have to do some work enabling attacks"  
- "if you don't win quickly you just know you're losing to Rooms"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Delirium - Viable, but maybe not top tier; Green-Black is best home  
**Timestamp:** 00:12:00 & 00:24:00  
**Take:** Delirium is a viable strategy, particularly in Green-Black, which is still considered Tier 1 (though at the bottom). However, the aggro version (Green-Red) is weak, and enabling it requires careful deckbuilding. It benefits from creatures with multiple types.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I still think [Black Green Delirium is] good it's probably not the best deck in in the format... I still think it's a very good deck"  
- "[Green-Red Delirium] the Commons just aren't good enough... there's just not enough of a payoff and you have to do enough work to get delirium"  
- "if you are delirium you really want cards that are artifact creature or enchantment creature... getting one of those to trade and then only needing to get instant sorcery in the yard... that's a a big piece of the puzzle to getting delirium to go quickly"  
**Confidence Level:** High (for GB being good), High (for GR being weak)  

## Archetype Predictions / Re-evaluations  

### Overall Format Dynamic - Aggro vs. Late Game (Rooms)  
**Timestamp:** 00:10:30  
**Take:** The format is defined by a tension between strong aggressive decks (Red-White, Blue-White) trying to get under the powerful late-game Rooms decks (Blue-Red, 5-color). Traditional mid-range strategies are squeezed unless they are exceptionally strong (like Green-Black Delirium).  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "pushes the format towards the opposite ends of the spectrum like you either want to be aggressive to get underneath the rims deck or you want to be a rim deck playing the late game"  
- "being in the middle is a really tough spot to be I think because of the existence of the rooms deck"  
- "I think this form's going to be really cool because it's got... a very wide variety of archetypes and strategies and I really like formats where there's the push pull tension of a good late game deck and good aggro deck"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Black-White (Reanimator) - Underperforming, Bottom Tier  
**Timestamp:** 00:15:15  
**Take:** Black-White Reanimator is clunky, requires drawing specific pieces in the right order, is vulnerable to common removal, doesn't overlap with other archetypes, and its payoff isn't always game-winning against decks like Rooms. Considered bottom tier.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "it doesn't have overlap really with other archetypes"  
- "you have to draw the right parts of your deck right in the right order"  
- "the deck is a little it's a little clunky you got to draw all the right pieces"  
- "there's some great removal in the formats you can do all this work to reanimate... and then your opponent can answer your card with a single blue Mana"  
- "not close to a tier one archetype I think certainly towards the bottom of the archetypes"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Blue-White (Eerie Tempo/Aggro) - Overperforming, Top Tier  
**Timestamp:** 00:16:45  
**Take:** Blue-White has been very impressive as a strong tempo/aggro deck. Eerie is good, it plays good Rooms, and has strong synergistic potential. Considered a top-tier aggro deck. Can also potentially be built as control.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "blue white on the other hand has been very impressive it seems like a super strong Tempo aggro deck"  
- "Eerie is good it gets to play the Good rooms there's a lot of synergy that can pop off in the blue white decks"  
- "I would have that very high up on the list of aggro decks"  
- "I definitely think you'll see blue white control decks in the format as well"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Green-White (Survival) - Underperforming, Bottom Tier  
**Timestamp:** 00:18:00  
**Take:** Reiteration that Green-White Survival is a weak mid-range deck lacking good common/uncommon support, particularly cheap enablers. Bottom tier archetype to avoid.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "it's pretty midrangey and I think it doesn't have lots of good Survivor cards at common and uncommon in the two drop slot"  
- "I think that's an archetype to try to steer away from I would put that in the bottom tier I think"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Blue-Red (Rooms) - Overperforming, Top Tier  
**Timestamp:** 00:18:30 & 00:26:45  
**Take:** Blue-Red Rooms (often splashing into 4-5 colors) is a premier late-game strategy and a top-tier archetype, leveraging the power of the Room mechanic.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "blue red rooms we we can't sing rooms Praises enough"  
- "blue red rooms SL five color room soup like blue red denoting rooms dominance" (in Tier 1 list)  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Blue-Black (Eerie Control) - Mid-Tier, Needs Finishers  
**Timestamp:** 00:18:50  
**Take:** Blue-Black Eerie Control has tools to survive the early game but struggles to close out the game without powerful rares or bombs. It risks being out-valued by dedicated Rooms decks. Might have potential as a tempo deck, but less supported.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "my feeling with it was that I didn't have any oomph to win the late game I had the tools to get there and then once I got there I had nothing to do"  
- "you probably need rares you probably need bombs to be happy with this deck"  
- "I do think it's in danger of just losing to better late game decks"  
- "maybe I don't know [about Eerie Tempo viability]"  
**Confidence Level:** Medium-High (on control assessment), Low (on tempo viability)  

### Blue-Green (Manifest Dread) - Mid-Tier, High Potential but Fragile  
**Timestamp:** 00:20:15  
**Take:** Blue-Green Manifest Dread relies heavily on key uncommons (Oblivious Bookworm, Paranormal Analyst). If these are answered, the deck struggles. It's currently seen as a worse late-game deck than Rooms, but has potential to improve as players optimize builds. Teamer (splashing Red for Rooms) seems promising.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "if those [Bookworm, Analyst] die your deck Falls flat"  
- "oblivious Bookworm is just great and you don't need to go so hard on manifest dread"  
- "I think at its core this is a late game deck and it's worse than rooms in the late game"  
- "Teamer was like a very impressive three color wedge in the in the Early Access thing for me"  
**Confidence Level:** High (on current assessment), Medium (on potential improvement)  

### Red-White (Aggro) - Huge Overperformer, Top Tier  
**Timestamp:** 00:21:45  
**Take:** Red-White Aggro was significantly underestimated and is now considered a top-tier archetype (#1 or #2). It has numerous ways to push damage, close games unexpectedly, and leverages the "power 2 or less" synergies well. Likely the best Best-of-One deck.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "red white has trophied like six out of nine times [in testing]"  
- "red white has shot up to number one or number two yeah"  
- "red white has so many ways to push damage and randomly close out the game"  
- "the deck is really good"  
- "that's certainly I think going to be the front runner for best of one darling best archetype in the format yeah"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Green-Black (Delirium) - Good, Tier 1 (Low End)  
**Timestamp:** 00:24:00  
**Take:** Green-Black Delirium remains a very good archetype, likely the best mid-range option, sitting at the bottom end of Tier 1.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "green black I still think very good um just probably not the best archetype right probably in it might still be in the where is it yeah it's still in your in your tier one"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Green-Red (Delirium Aggro) - Underperforming, Bottom Tier  
**Timestamp:** 00:24:30  
**Take:** Green-Red Delirium Aggro is finicky and underpowered. The common payoffs aren't strong enough, enabling delirium is work, it's vulnerable to graveyard hate, and it's significantly worse than Red-White or Blue-White aggro. Bottom tier.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "Finicky I I don't like it the Commons just aren't good enough"  
- "there's just not enough of a payoff and you have to do enough work to get delirium"  
- "it's just a much worse aggro deck than both red white and blue white"  
- "it is the worst of the aggro decks"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Red-Black (Sacrifice/Aristocrats) - Good, Tier 2  
**Timestamp:** 00:25:45  
**Take:** Red-Black Sacrifice felt pretty good, likely best built with an aggressive slant. It benefits from sacrificing enchantments (including Rooms). Solid Tier 2 archetype.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "it felt pretty darngood I do think you want to build it with again an aggressive Bend"  
- "because red black is sacrifice a creature or enchantment right you do get the rooms you play You're G to you want rooms"  
- "I think red black is still good not tier one but I'd put it in tier I like it in tier two where you have it"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Archetype Tier List (Current Assessment)  
**Timestamp:** 00:26:45  
**Take:** A revised tier list based on early play.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- **Tier 1:** Red-White Aggro, Blue-White Aggro/Tempo, Blue-Red Rooms (inc. 5c), Green-Black Delirium (low T1)  
- **Tier 2:** Red-Black Sacrifice, Blue-Green Manifest Dread, Blue-Black Control/Tempo  
- **Tier 3:** Green-Red Delirium Aggro, Green-White Survival, Black-White Reanimator  
**Confidence Level:** High (for this point in time)  

## Color Pair Analysis / Color Power Rankings  

### Color Power Rankings (Current Assessment)  
**Timestamp:** 00:27:30  
**Take:** A complete reversal from initial impressions, driven by the performance of Rooms and Aggro strategies.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- **1. Red:** Stocks way up. Supports top-tier aggro (RW) and top-tier late game (UR Rooms), with solid Tier 2 options (RB). Very flexible.  
- **2. Blue:** Very impressive. Supports top-tier aggro (UW) and top-tier late game (UR Rooms), plus viable Tier 2 options (UB, UG).  
- **3. White:** Strong aggressive color (best pure aggro). Supports top-tier aggro (RW, UW), but weaker archetypes otherwise (GW, BW).  
- **4. Green:** Moved down significantly. GB Delirium is good, but other archetypes (GW, GR) are weak, and UG is still being figured out. Commons seem less impactful pull into the color.  
- **5. Black:** Moved down significantly. Only GB is Tier 1. Other archetypes (BW, UB, RB) are Tier 2 or lower. Lacks strong standalone commons.  
**Confidence Level:** High (for this point in time)  

## Card Evaluations  

### Overperformers  

#### Acrobatic Cheerleader  
**Timestamp:** 00:28:50  
**Take:** Excellent aggressive common two-drop, great in Red-White and Blue-White, not just a Green-White Survival card. Best aggressive common 2-drop.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "this is just great in your red white aggro and your blue white Tempo decks yeah this is the best aggressive two drop at common"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Unable to Scream  
**Timestamp:** 00:29:20  
**Take:** Incredible in late-game decks (like Blue-Red Rooms) to buy time. Also very good in Blue-White Eerie Tempo for double spelling and enabling enchantment synergies.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "if you want to get to the late game unable to scream is incredible"  
- "also blue white Eerie Tempo loves this card as a way to double spell and get a creature like out of the Skies or whatever"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Grand Entryway // Elegant Rotunda  
**Timestamp:** 00:30:00  
**Take:** Very strong aggressive Room, particularly in Blue-White where the front half double triggers Eerie for two mana.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "the fact that grand entryway double triggers Eerie for two Mana right so it's coming in as an enchantment and then it's making a glimmer token as well it really pops off in blue white"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Optimistic Scavenger  
**Timestamp:** 00:30:25  
**Take:** Even better than it looked initially, synergizes powerfully with enchantments entering and Rooms unlocking, especially in Blue-White.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "this card looked good to us I think it is even better than it looked"  
- "if optimistic scaven into Grand entryway into unlocking elegant retunda like it's a very powerful start"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Land Cyclers (Blue/Green)  
**Timestamp:** 00:30:50  
**Take:** While not amazing overall, the Blue and Green land cyclers are actively desirable in Manifest Dread decks to provide large bodies to flip into. Might want 3-4 total land cyclers in such decks.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I do think the blue and green one stock have gone up quite a bit and I do think you actively want copies of those in Manifest Destiny [Dread] decks"  
- "I would want to play something like 15 lands three land cyclers 15 lands four land cyclers"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Meat Locker // Drowned Diner  
**Timestamp:** 00:31:30  
**Take:** Huge mover up. Initially thought to be mediocre, now considered a premium common, potentially one of the top 10 commons. Excellent in control/Rooms decks, playable everywhere in blue. Better than Glimmerburst.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "this card I think is the card that has moved up the most for me out of every card like I would have thought this card was dle just didn't matter or whatever and I think this is a premium common now"  
- "I think this is better than glimmer burst which is very weird for me to wrap my head around"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Creatures with Two Types (e.g., Grasping Longneck)  
**Timestamp:** 00:32:45  
**Take:** Creatures that are Artifact Creature or Enchantment Creature are valuable for enabling Delirium more easily, making cards like Grasping Longneck better than pure filler in those decks.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "if you are delirium you really want cards that are artifact creature or enchantment creature... getting one of those to trade... or flipping one of those when you manifest dread and having it be two types in one card that's a a big piece of the puzzle"  
- "Grasping Longneck... it's like filler Plus in Delirium decks"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Fear of Lost Teeth  
**Timestamp:** 00:33:30  
**Take:** Great defensive card for late-game decks (especially Blue-Black) and excellent sacrifice fodder in Red-Black, particularly good as it has two types for Delirium.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "this card looked great going in and I think is great it's great on defense too if you want to get to the late game and care about delirium"  
- "I think it's extremely strong in red black specifically... it's really good sack fodder there and its two types"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Glass Works // Shattered Yard  
**Timestamp:** 00:34:15  
**Take:** Excellent synergistic removal spell (the "saver of the format"). Very strong common Room.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "this is the saver of the format it's just a synergistic removal spell and that that is so so so so strong"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Most Valuable Slayer  
**Timestamp:** 00:34:35  
**Take:** The real deal for aggressive red decks. Enabling attacks the turn it comes down (like Combat Professor) is very powerful.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "that card is the real deal for red Decks that want to push damage"  
- "you called it combat professor and I think that's right... the fact that it does it when it comes in is is pretty big game"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Rampaging Soulrager  
**Timestamp:** 00:35:15  
**Take:** Much better than initially thought due to Rooms being great. A 1/4 that becomes a 4/4 payoff for unlocking doors is strong, especially with 4 toughness being relevant. Often available late.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "rooms are great like I think we were like H not excited about this card but really excited about rooms and as a result this card is really good"  
- "if you do [have enough rooms] and you have enough rooms card is very very strong because like the four toughness"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Glimmer Light
**Timestamp:** 00:35:50  
**Take:** A tight, efficient package that's very good in Blue-White Eerie Tempo, providing an Eerie trigger and helping push damage. A good aggressive common "two drop" (though maybe played later). Has broad applications ("golden egg-y").  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "it's exactly what you want in blue white Eerie Tempo because it gives you the Eerie trigger while also helping you push damage"  
- "it is just a tight efficient little package that is I think very good in the format"  
- "I still feel pretty good about my take on this being golden egg-y"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Sheltered by Ghosts  
**Timestamp:** 00:36:45  
**Take:** (Disagreement noted - Overperformer for Ben). Backbreaking removal/buff aura. Ward 2 is very difficult to overcome, and it dictates the opponent's plays even if eventually answered. Pushed up to A- evaluation.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I said I could push this up to a minus I would at this point this card is it has been backbreaking"  
- "Ward two on this feels like ah cost so much... by the time you have have five Mana to play glass works or whatever to kill the thing through the ward it's too late"  
- "it forces you like you completely dictate how your opponent has to spend like the next two to three turns of the game trying to deal with this thing"  
**Confidence Level:** High (Ben), Medium/Lower (Ethan implies some reservation)  

#### Split-Skin Doll  
**Timestamp:** 00:37:55  
**Take:** Great aggressive two-drop in white decks. Often cantrips and provides the body needed for aggressive strategies.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "this is just a great two drop in white aggro Decks that want to be aggressive"  
- "this is often just get a creature on the board cantrip everything the white decks want to do"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Bottomless Pool // Locker Room  
**Timestamp:** 00:38:20  
**Take:** The front half (bounce spell) is already good in tempo decks (especially Blue-White) as a cheap Eerie trigger that buys time. The back half is gravy. Good even in control Rooms decks just for the cheap interaction.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "if this were only bottomless pool it would be good in this format like especially in in blue white Tempo decks"  
- "you're very interested in bottomless pool because you you can afford to spend single blue and a card to give yourself more time"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Fear of Being Hunted  
**Timestamp:** 00:39:15  
**Take:** Huge mover up. Randomly insane when it acts as removal (3-mana FTK) and absolutely broken when curved into Most Valuable Slayer (5/2 First Strike, must be blocked).  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "this card has been a huge mover up for me... it's randomly insane right if your opponent like has a one3 back or an 04 back"  
- "absolutely broken with it into the curve of most valuable Slayer because then you have a 52 First Strike must be blocked"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Routclaw's Survivor  
**Timestamp:** 00:40:00  
**Take:** Better than initially thought. Snowbally if it connects (which haste helps enable). Closes the game quickly by attacking and making another threat. Has "Ambuscade" vibes.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I was low on it as a card until I played against it and if it has an uncontested attack... it does close the game out in a hurry"  
- "connecting plus making another free three three two two three powered things for five Mana one of them having haste is pretty strong I think"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Greenhouse // Rickety Gazebo  
**Timestamp:** 00:40:50  
**Take:** A really good build-around uncommon for 5-color Room Soup decks and potentially turbo self-mill strategies. Provides fixing and late-game card advantage/selection. Requires accounting for tempo loss on turn 3.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "this is one of the best things you can have if you are doing five color room soup"  
- "what's also really good in the turbo self Mill stack your deck style which is also real"  
- "the thing you have to be aware of... you have to be able to count for doing nothing on turn three"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Arabella, Abandoned Doll  
**Timestamp:** 00:41:50  
**Take:** Much better than initial evaluation (closer to B+/A-). Attacks often enough, synergizes with combat tricks/evasion (Ragged Playmate), provides reach/lifegain, and makes racing impossible. Worth first picking.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "the answer is [it attacks] often enough plus plus your opponent has to run into combat tricks"  
- "later in the game you have five creatures with power two or less and it's a lava axe that gains you five life also it just makes it impossible to race as well"  
- "Arabella is one that is much more valuable should you be willing to first pick Arabella like absolutely"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Cracked Skull  
**Timestamp:** 00:42:45  
**Take:** (Overperformer for Ethan). Better than initially thought, specifically in Red-Black (as sacrifice fodder) and Blue-Black (synergy with Fear of Lost Teeth for removal). Annoying to play against.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I have been impressed by this in two spots red black and blue black"  
- "in red black as something plus an enchantment that's hanging around for you to sacrifice"  
- "in blue black in conjunction with fear of lost teeth... fear of Lost teeth plus cracked skull is excellent"  
**Confidence Level:** High (Ethan), Medium (Ben seems convinced)  

#### Sporogenic Infection  
**Timestamp:** 00:43:35  
**Take:** Better than it looked (Ethan thought it looked good initially). Can function as an Edict if the opponent only has one creature (by targeting your own). Provides an enchantment body for sacrifice decks and is annoying removal otherwise. Very good.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "one thing that I missed is that if your opponent has one creature in play you can cast this on your own creature and it will edict them"  
- "if you're a deck that again cares about that rectangle being on the battlefield as an enchantment... that's upside"  
- "card's very good"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Ragged Playmate  
**Timestamp:** 00:44:25  
**Take:** Good card that helps push damage in aggressive decks by making small creatures unblockable, synergizing well with pump effects or cards like Arabella.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "this just really helps push damage because there's so many ways for you to do that and then pump the thing or the sneaks in an Arabella whatever card's just good"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Broodspinner  
**Timestamp:** 00:44:45  
**Take:** Excellent card, potentially even better than initially thought. Happy to first pick this as a pull into Green-Black. Instant speed activation is powerful.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I thought this card was great and it is like it's every bit as excellent if not a little bit more"  
- "I'm happy to first pick this card and have this as a reason to go into black green"  
- "the fact that you can sack this at instant speed that you get to go like chump sack here's 511 Flyers that are going to win me the game really powerful"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Underperformers  

#### Bale-Mar Leeches  
**Timestamp:** 00:45:35  
**Take:** Atrocious. Represents the type of card (small body, low impact in non-aggro) that is a trap in this format. Putting this in a control deck is like taking a mulligan.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "absolutely atrocious in this format which is like a a 2 two in a non-Agro deck that doesn't help you really get to the late game"  
- "this is you are putting a mulligan in your deck if you put this in your blue black Eerie deck"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Fanatic of the Harrowing  
**Timestamp:** 00:46:10  
**Take:** Body is too small and irrelevant. Not a good card, maybe playable in the bad Reanimator deck.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "you were right about this body is too small yeah it's just not been good the 2 two is not relevant"  
- "this this is just not a good card"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Manifest Dread (Sorcery)  
**Timestamp:** 00:46:35  
**Take:** Fine, but not a pull into Green. Doesn't do enough on its own. Contributes to awkward sorcery/creature ratios in Manifest decks.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "this is fine but it doesn't pull you into green by any stretch"  
- "it's just not good enough to be a pull into green"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Say Its Name  
**Timestamp:** 00:47:15  
**Take:** Fine, but not a pull into Green. Contributes to awkward deckbuilding constraints in Delirium/Manifest decks (hitting sorceries off Manifest Dread). Better decks don't have these constraints.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "another fine card it's just it's just not enough to pull you into green"  
- "there's just a chain reaction of like all these knobs to dial into exactly the right amounts that the bet that the better decks don't have to do"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Spine-Seeker Centipede  
**Timestamp:** 00:47:50  
**Take:** Still a very good card, but not a strong pull into Green. Feels a bit small ball, opponent can often ignore the body. Competes directly with the Green Room that finds a land (Greenhouse?), which is often preferred in late-game decks. More homeless than expected.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I just again like I thought this was going to pull you into green and I don't think it should it's a little bit small ball for the format"  
- "your opponents can largely just ignore this body"  
- "if you're SPL if you're doing a a late game room splashing thing you want that [Greenhouse] over centipede like every time"  
- "it is a little bit homeless kind of yeah and I think as a result just shouldn't pull you into green"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Orphans of the Wheat
**Timestamp:** 00:49:15  
**Take:** Still a pretty good card, but not a pull into White and nowhere near the top uncommon status initially predicted. Trades too easily in Green-White Survival. Impressive in Red-White Aggro though.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "it's just not a pull into white"  
- "if you are relying on this in green white survival it trades way too easily"  
- "I thought this was going to be one of the top uncommons in the set and I think it is nowhere close to that"  
- "[Ethan impressed by it in RW]: the fact that you get to tap things... you can make it unblockable... now you're chunking in for five"  
**Confidence Level:** High (that it's not top tier), Medium (Ben might be too low based on Ethan's RW experience)  

#### Fearful Fathoms (likely meant Fear Fail Tests?)  
**Timestamp:** 00:50:20  
**Take:** Big clunky creature without an ETB. Doesn't provide mana advantage, which is more crucial than card advantage in late-game mirrors. Feels bad to cast when behind or at parity. Homeless.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "this is just kind of a big clunky creature without an ETB and those are I'm out on those at the moment"  
- "it is hard to get Mana advantage and this doesn't really do that for you so I think this is just also again kind of homeless"  
- "if you were ever trying to cast this to air quote stabilize it felt bad"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Miasma Demon  
**Timestamp:** 00:51:15  
**Take:** Way too high on this initially (B+/A-). It's a C or C+ at best. You rarely have enough cards to discard when you cast it for the effect to be impactful. Much worse than the 7-drop black Edict creature.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "we were way too high on this... this is a c at best C+"  
- "you just don't have that many cards in your hand when you finally land this thing"  
- "way better than miasma demon I don't think they're they're very comparable"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Defiled Crypt // Cadaver Lab  
**Timestamp:** 00:52:20  
**Take:** More of a build-around than intrinsically good. Needs specific enablers (like Ghost Vacuum or self-mill payoffs) to function. The engine itself (making 2/2s) isn't powerful enough to win the late game against top decks like Rooms. Raise Dead on its own isn't good.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "I think on its own I'm not interested in this like I think you want to make sure you you can do this"  
- "if your deck isn't doing the engine thing with it then you're just playing raised dead in your deck and that's not a good card"  
- "even the engine thing just isn't good enough... like a stream of tutos doesn't win the late game"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Alton, the Thrice-Cursed  
**Timestamp:** 00:53:35  
**Take:** Lower on this due to being lower on Green, lower on Say Its Name, and lower on big clunky creatures in general. Not a pull into Green, just a C/C+ card.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "this is all you know Ripple effects of we're lower on green we're lower on say it name and I'm just also lower on like this is the big clunky creatures"  
- "this isn't this just isn't a pull this is again this is a c C+"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

### Other Discussed Cards (Mixed/Uncertain Takes)  

#### Innocuous Rat
**Timestamp:** 00:54:20  
**Take:** Likely too small ball for the format generally, but might have a specific home in Red-Black Sacrifice.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "is that just too small ball for the format... it's my guess is it's home is red black exactly okay"  
**Confidence Level:** Medium  

#### Winner's Intervention  
**Timestamp:** 00:54:35  
**Take:** Bad. Too narrow, doesn't kill key 3-toughness threats (Arabella, Bookworm). Unhappy playing it. Should be rated zero.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "seems pretty narrow and a lot of the good cards that are early that you want to kill have three toughness... this doesn't kill"  
- "I have played with this card and was extremely unhappy with it I'm I'm out on Winner's intervention"  
**Confidence Level:** High (that it's bad)  

#### Impossible Inferno  
**Timestamp:** 00:55:05  
**Take:** Niche removal spell, primarily for Red-Green or Jund Delirium decks. Not a pull into Red, not played in faster decks like Red-White. You'll know when you want it.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "certainly doesn't pull you into red"  
- "I think that's it's basically in exactly one deck [Red-Green/Jund]"  
- "you'll know when you want it"  
**Confidence Level:** High  

#### Ethereal Armor  
**Timestamp:** 00:55:50  
**Take:** Haven't seen it, but seems potentially broken in Blue-White Eerie Tempo. Cheap, high impact, might overcome the usual Aura drawback. Only playable in that specific deck.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "ethereal armor just seems broken in blue white yeah"  
- "this is a good enough aura that it gets past the downside"  
- "that's the de the only deck for it right I think so yeah"  
**Confidence Level:** Medium (speculative)  

#### Centipede Anthro-pede  
**Timestamp:** 00:56:35  
**Take:** Likely better than initially thought because Rooms are good. Provides a relevant body (3/4 Reach) that can destroy a Room, which is valuable for non-Room decks trying to compete in the late game (like Green-Black Delirium). Likely an overperformer.  
**Supporting Statements:**  
- "if rooms are good I think it has to be I think this has to be better than we thought"  
- "if you're trying it all to not to get to the the late game and compete with the rooms deck I think you want this because those decks also want ways to not die to Flyers"  
- "I think this card has got a home in the format I think it's going to be an over performer"  
**Confidence Level:** High (that it's better than thought)
